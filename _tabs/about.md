<p> I'm a Full Stack Data Scientist from London and work in the financial sector. My love for data began in 2016 and I feel so privileged to be part of this community. I love contributing to open source projects in my spare time and also  experimenting with new techniques and tools. On this website you will find a few practical blogs/tutorials I have written for a range of topics including Machine Learning (ML) Techniques for a range of use cases, Cloud services, Python and 
other tooling/packages which I have found handy in the ML software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>
Prior to this a.k.a in my previous life, I was working in the healthcare sector as a physicist, carrying out quality control, image/data analysis and research associated with radiation and imaging technology.

<p>
Outside of work, I like gaming on my PS5 and comp - some of my favourites being CyberPunk, SniperElite5, Zombie Army 4 and 
Watch Dogs:Legion.
