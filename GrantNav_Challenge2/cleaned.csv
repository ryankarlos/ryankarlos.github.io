Mathematical modelling of Barrett's Esophagus development,"The molecular mechanisms that control the progression of Barrett_验s Oesophagus (BE) to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are not well established. Recently, age-related changes in DNA methylation have been identified that have led to the notion of a biological tissue age, which can be inferred from patient-specific methylation data. My host lab has collected methylation data from multiple spatial areas (from the stomach and along the oesophagus) in a number of BE patients. These samples have revealed that the BE nearest the stomach is older than more proximal BE. To explain these data we hypothesise that BE is established at the stomach and subsequently spreads up along the oesophagus . In this study, I will test this hypothesis by:(a) constructing a computational model of BE formation in the human oesophagus that includes biological growth parameters such as cell birth, death and fitness and models DNA methylation changes.(b) comparing the model to methylation data to define the timescales involved in the growth of BE to a certain length and the biophysical processes that are necessary to explain the data.The outcome of this project will be the construction and parameterisation of a model that explains BE development.",0,27/04/2017,Queen Mary University of London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,sports and fitness,Research

Orkney community digital heritage,"Orkney has a rich, unrecorded cultural heritage, consisting e.g. of minor place-names and stories connected to specific places and landscape features. A lot of this heritage exists in the oral culture and memory of elderly community members and could easily be lost to future generations. This project proposes to work with the Orkney Heritage Society, involving older members of the Orkney community, and teach them how to employ digital technology to record, preserve and share this heritage.     To capture place-names and folklore in the landscape, we will use smartphones and the digital app EDINA Fieldwork GB, showing people how to use this app to record stories, place-names and take digital photographs. We will also create an easy-to-use website and give community members the skills to upload their material captured with the app. Community members will also be shown how to scan and upload old photographs and relevant documents that they may have to the website. This work will take place at the CNS premises. The project is very well suited to introduce digital technology to users who are not normally using such tools, through an activity which depends and builds on their interests and knowledge. Our aim is that they will continue to use the app and website after project end, and that they will be inspired to explore other kinds of digital technology.",15091,25/05/2015,Centre for Nordic Studies,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,,N,elderly,Community
Crookston Community WWW Club,"The project will provide a platform for females from the Black and ethnic minority communities to come together in a spirit of community and learning to access basic IT skills. Our aim is to have a sustainable project and as such in year two we aim to additionally offer an intermediate IT course.     Given that many of our service users have never used a desk top, a lap top or a tablet, it is necessary to first make individuals familiar with the hardware and allow them to feel comfortable around the equipment. It is vital to create a comfortable environment where individuals are not only attending to learn but attending to make friends and contacts who will become their external support networks. Support networks can prove vital in helping to support and encourage the educational progression of individuals and can lead to enhanced computer literacy skills, as often individuals will take their learning home, share their learning and therefore independently expand their learning.     By virtue of the project individuals will learn the skills to set up social network accounts and thereby stay in touch with family and friends via Skype, Facebook, and Twitter etc. Through our other projects we have learnt that some of our female service users who, for example, have had to leave their loved ones behind and seek refuge or asylum in this country often are devoid of any support, financial or otherwise. Therefore they may not have access to resources which enables them to stay in touch with their loved ones. This adds to their sense of isolation and exclusion in a country in which they know and have very little. This can and does affect their mental and physical health. Therefore, the ability to connect with loved ones not only breaks their sense of isolation/exclusion but can help improve their physical and mental wellbeing which is essential to their effective integration in societal life and in them exercising active citizenship.     Participants will learn to surf the net, to access educational websites; health websites; to type in and learn of what is happening locally so they can attend events and meet people. Additionally individuals will be encouraged and supported in making online applications for i.e. benefits; colleges; employment opportunities. They will be introduced to Microsoft word and will be taught how to write a document, save a document and print a document etc.     Emails are an instant and effective way of communication and participants will be assisted in creating email accounts, managing emails and will be encouraged to regularly email other participants of the project in order to build their confidence in communicating in this way.   Through the project our aim is not only to provide and develop digital skills and experiences but it_验s also to encourage excluded individuals and communities to access and benefit from educational, employment and training opportunities that will help break their sense of isolation and exclusion.",7744,17/11/2015,Crookston Community Group,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,,N,environment,Community

William Grey Walter and the Burden Neurological Institute,"This secondment project seeks to improve the organisation, accessibility, and public knowledge of the objects and papers held by the Science Museum relating to the work of William Grey Walter and his colleagues at the Burden Neurological Institute (BNI). Documenting pioneering work that has left a profound mark on clinical research and practice, the BNI collection constitutes one of the richest archival and material resources in Britain for understanding the development of twentieth-century neuroscience. This project aims to raise the profile of this unique resource in three ways. Firstly, the project will digitise and expand the existing catalogues of the BNI collection, empowering researchers to locate and use materials in new and innovative ways. Secondly, the project will provide fully researched biographies of key personnel for the 'creators' records on the Science Museum's Collections online website. These will provide comprehensive yet accessible introductions to the careers and personalities that shaped the BNI's work. Finally, the project will produce an online visual resource open to both researchers and the public. Using the recorded brain waves of the electroencephalograph (EEG) as a model, this resource will help users to visualise how the documents, objects, and personalities of the BNI interacted. ",12577,25/05/2017,Queen Mary University of London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Evolution of insecticide resistance in vectors sustaining residual malaria transmission in Kenya,"Vector control using Insecticide treated materials (ITM) has been the primary intervention of choice to curb the spread of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Widespread use of these interventions has led to decline of malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality thus prompting World health organization and other players to consider shifting their focus from controlling to elimination phase. However, the major challenge to Kenya and other countries aiming to eliminate malaria is residual transmission, sustained by increased changes in vector population composition, behavioral changes in secondary vectors of malaria and the rising level of insecticide resistance (IR).To  effectively manage IR and maximize effectiveness of the current and future control interventions, I propose to conduct a comprehensive study to characterize IR genotypes of these vectors; to determine how population structures influences changes in vector behavior, rates of gene flow and frequency of IR genes; to determine the association of sporozoite rates, environmental and socio-economic factors with IR frequency and also to determine how evolution of variabilities in IR gene loci over time leads to increased IR frequency in Kenya.",122899,25/11/2015,Kemri-Wellcome Trust Research Programme,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
 _焉People like you_验: contemporary figures of personalisation,"We aim to contribute to critical medical humanities by investigating an emergent culture of personalisation in the UK, associated concepts of the person and health. We expect to stimulate debate on personalised medicine by showing how it can be understood more fully in relation to other personalising practices and how features shared across this broad field are consequential for our wellbeing. Our innovative figural approach will be applied to case studies of both top-down and open-ended practices of personalisation in medicine, data science and digital culture. In collaboration with creative consultants, we will conduct practice-led research to produce additional insight into the role of participation in, and the sense made of, personalisation. Our aim is to put the _焉person_验 back into personalisation, and relate such persons to the data collected from them and on their behalf. This approach will allow us to investigate individuals_验 sense of self, agency and identification with others. It will allow us to consider the implications of new techniques for stratifying _焉persons_验 precisely in shaping health outcomes and healthcare priorities. In sum, we will assess whether personalising practices, considered together, are influencing taken-for-granted concepts of the person with consequences for individual and collective health.  ",368906,01/02/2017,University of Warwick,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Transforming brain recordings with next-generation probes,"Thanks to the Wellcome Trust and other leading international institutions, we have developed and proved the viability of a new generation of recording probes that will transform electrophysiology. These ""Neuropixels"" probes transcend past approaches, recording hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously. Several key steps are now necessary to maximize the impact of this new technology, enabling its widespread use in the neuroscience community. We must develop radically new recording equipment and software, provide training, and build a collaborative community of users (Aim 1). To allow this community to fully exploit the potential of this technology, we must extend it to a larger range of applications: multi-shank probes, wireless recording for freely moving animals, and optrodes for use with optogenetics (Aim 2). Meanwhile, we will obtain ground-truth data to calibrate error rates, and begin the development of a tool to automatically identify brain regions based on electrophysiological characteristics (Aim 3). This project integrates software and hardware engineering, fabrication efforts, neurophysiology tests, and behavioral and anatomical techniques. It thus requires a collaboration between laboratories with different skill sets, and a unique nanoelectronics research partner, IMEC.

Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship,"I want to make the case for how conversation can both challenge and enhance the empirical side of health practice and research, to develop ways people interface with biomedical science and to infuse this space of coexistence with desire, creating spaces where different kinds of people want to be. I want to co-create new ways to behave in this space and to talk about what we know. I hope this will be a space where our cognitive and associative, considered and impulsive, feeling and desiring selves ask important scientific questions. I will do this by developing, establishing and disseminating modes of conversation that use performance methodologies as a crucial part of health communication and care. I will experiment with how these interventions enable people to air their own stories, thinking and perceptions on important issues, working toward making knowledge exchange more egalitarian and influencing social change connected to health and the human condition.My ongoing research experiments with performance as a means of public engagement and I have used these experiments to provide diverse (and often socially excluded) groups with platforms to think about and debate serious issues in safe stimulating environments. Interventions have included Long Tables, Fantasy Personas, Creative Hosting, Porch Sitting, Green Screening and my YouTube channel hosted by my own fantasy persona/interlocutor, Tammy WhyNot. Examples of this work include: collaboration with Dr Alison Mears, Consultant in GUM/HIV, on Q and As facilitated by Tammy in theatres and online; What Tammy Needs to Know About Getting Old and Having Sex, a performance collaboration with older adults, including workshops with elders in Croatia, where I lived in an elders_验 care home for ten days; DemTech, an AHRC/EPSRC funded collaborative project with psychologist Prof Pat Healey investigating how elders could be empowered to think about and influence future technologies through adopting fantasy personas. Although this work will be applicable to an intergenerational public, I want to start with my current research collaborators, elders, before expanding to include other diverse groups of people. Despite being a rapidly increasing demographic, elders are becoming progressively more invisible and absent from decision making and public life, leading to isolation, depression, ambulatory health conditions and decreased resilience. As an elder myself I want to be an authentic interlocutor who engages scientists and the public and clinicians and seniors. This is one way my work is unique; usually such activities are developed 'for' elders by others (Bliss 2016). I want to create elder-led visibility, confidence and wellbeing, to create robust evidence to demonstrate how agency creates wellbeing for elders, how my methods contribute to this, how they can contribute better, how conversation can effectively engage the public in debate about issues raised by biomedical research, and how this can lead to better informed research outcomes and policy-making. I want to influence policy, creating long term and large scale empowerment, which directly impacts on improved health conditions.

Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV research Excellence (SANTHE),"We will create a sub-Saharan African network of African-led research in HIV (particularly acute HIV (AHI)) and Tuberculosis (TB) infection, which will shape and drive locallyrelevant basic, clinical and translational research in Africa. Our four institutional partnersare all well-established sites: the KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for TB and HIV (K-RITH) and the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) (South Africa), the Rwanda-Zambia HIV Research Group (RZHRG) (Rwanda and Zambia), the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP) (Kenya), and the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP) (Botswana). K-RITH/UKZN and RZHRG have been collaborating as part of the Canada-sub Saharan Africa (CANSSA) HIV/AIDS network; and K-RITH/UKZN, RZHRG, KWTRP, and our collaborating partners for this grant, the University of Nairobi (Kenya), the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)/IAVI site (Uganda), and Aurum Institute (South Africa) have collaborated through an AHI network. New collaborating partners include: University of Rwanda, University of Zambia, and University of Botswana. Our group combines world-renowned expertise in heterosexual HIV transmission in discordant couple cohort studies in Zambia and Rwanda, TB in Botswana and South Africa, AHI studies in female and male cohorts in South Africa and Botswana, and homosexual cohort studies in Kenya. These existing research programmes are supported by long-term partners: Emory University, Harvard University, Oxford University, University College London, Einstein College of Medicine, University of Washington, Amsterdam University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Simon Fraser University and Hamburg University. Our programme strategy targets: 1. Expand on a cuttingedge HIV and TB research programme that includes basic, clinical and translational research. 2. Foster an innovative training and capacity building programme, to develop knowledge and skills for the next generation of African researchers across all institutional partner sites. 3. Facilitate a strong institutional network for research excellence as a pathway to intellectual andfinancial independence for African researchers and their institutions through pilot grants, infrastructure support and administrative support. 4. Create a programme for clinical studiesand community engagement to ensure meaningful translational research and public health and community impact. Our Network will aim to strengthen South-South partnerships, create enabling environments for excellence in research in Africa and train the next-generation leaders of African science. This consortium is specifically focused on HIV and TB as this syndemic' is a public health crisis in Africa that requires the full weight of basic science, translational/clinical research, and political and social mobilization. Although 5% of the world's population lives in Eastern and Southern Africa, they are home to approximately 50% of the world's population living with HIV. 2011 figures list the following prevalence rates in the countries participating in this grant: Kenya 6.2%, Uganda- 7.2%, Zambia- 12.5%, Botswana 23.4%, Rwanda 2.9%, and South Africa 17.3%. As a direct result of the HIV epidemic, TB is now devastating many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional TB statistics for 2012 lists Africa with the highest incidence of 2,300,000 for a population of 892,529,000. HIV can no longer be studied in isolation, and specific research capacity in HIV-TB coinfection also needs to be developed.",907616,05/05/2015,Africa Health Research Institute,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Science Learning +: Examining learning processes through the integration of two informal science learning approaches: Natural History Museum-led citizen science.,"Science Learning +: Examining learning processes through the integration of two informal science learning approaches: Natural History Museum-led citizen science. We focus our proposed practice-based, mixed-methods research on the priority areas of 1) understanding learning and 2) engagement in STEM by systematically examining the ways youth (ages 5-19 years) participate in authentic environmental science research, as facilitated by Natural History Museums (NHMs) in the US and the UK (NHM London, California Academy of Sciences, NHM Los Angeles County). Through integration of two approaches to informal science education i) natural history museums and ii) citizen science (CS), we examine three learning settings (event-based, longer-term outdoor monitoring, and online settings). Our goal is to address the overarching question: How do authentic science experiences such as NHM-led citizen science foster or support key practices of Environmental Science Agency (ESA)? Youth ESA includes: a) understanding the environmental science discipline_验s content and norms, b) identifying one_验s own expertise within the that discipline, and c) using the environmental science and CS project as a foundation for change in their own community. Through international collaboration between experts from diverse disciplines, environmental science, citizen science, museum practice, environmental education, learning analytics and technologies for pedagogy, this work will inform, and be informed by, science learning practice in both countries. Over four years we will: 1) explore and characterize youth participation in different learning environments, 2) examine learning outcomes across settings from a socio-cultural learning theory perspective, and 3) identify strategies that programs can implement to enhance learning outcomes. This proposal builds on years of our collaboration studying NHM-led citizen science (e.g.Ballard et al. in press), and PI Ballard (Univ. of CA, Davis) and Co-I Herodotou's (Open University) years of research on the learning outcomes of youth-focused citizen science. The NHMs, with their dual focus on science research and environmental education, established CS programs, close ties with local urban community-based organizations, and partnerships with large online CS platforms (Zooniverse and iNaturalist), provide a unique route through which we can examine how youth participation in authentic science may build their capacity and agency for science.",567747,07/11/2016,Natural History Museum,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Charity

Speech Audibility Improvement Project,"Sibford Village Hall is a popular and highly valued community asset, which is well used for a huge range of regular activities and special events, to meet both the needs of our own village residents, and those of residents in our surrounding area. However, a number of our Social, Community and Entertainment activities are highly dependent on having adequate sound quality, and in particular clear speech audibility, in our Village Hall, eg: _癣 Our Historical Society, Horticultural Society, Women_验s Institute, Quiz nights, and Charity lunches & auctions all rely on clear audibility of visiting guests speakers _癣 Our monthly Film Nights, which are provided by the Age UK charity, and are targeted at improving social inclusion for our elderly residents, all rely on the clear audibility of actors' speech from the film soundtrack. Although the acoustics in our Hall have been significantly improved by the installation of a suspended ceiling as part of our Energy Efficiency Project in 2016, some of our elderly and/or hearing-impaired residents remain excluded from both guest speaker and film events due to the still inadequate speech audibility in our Hall. We are planning to install a permanent Audio Visual system in our Hall to improve the general sound quality for all attendees at our guest speaker and film events. However, our primary aim is to include two specific features in the system which will positively transform speech audibility for our elderly and hearing-impaired Hall users: 1) A partial Surround Sound System, which will _岩decode_ the embedded speech channel on film DVDs and output this speech through a dedicated speaker at all our film events 2) A Hearing Aid Induction Loop System, which will allow users with compatible hearing aids to receive speech and film sound direct into their hearing aids (when switched to the _岩T_ setting) at both guest speaker and film events. We have obtained budget quotations, which indicate that the cost of a suitable system, including the above special features that would directly benefit our elderly and hearing impaired users, would be around 耄5,500.

Enhancing Informal Learning Through Citizen Science.,"Citizen science has grown significantly as an area of activity with many different models of practice and forms of participation. Citizen involvement in science can be seen as part of a long history of the role of the amateur inscience. Research in the USA and UK suggests that citizen science has a powerful potential to support participation in and the learning of science. Increasing research has sought to explore and measure the development of 'science literacy', science identity and learning outcomes through citizen science. The scale, focus, and organisation of projects has been demonstrated to influence who participates in them, the scientific achievements, and what volunteers learn. Such work has culminated recently in Phillips et al (2014) User's Guide for Evaluating Learning Outcomes From Citizen Science, based upon a four-year NSF-funded project called DEVISE. This builds upon earlier ground-breaking work, which identified various learning outcomes associated with different approaches to citizen science - contributory, collaborative and co-created. The Guide describes empirically defined outcomes for citizen science such as behaviour and stewardship, skills of science inquiry, knowledge of the nature of science, interest in science and the environment, self-efficacy and motivation. Focussing on large scale citizen science projects, this Science Learning+ project seeks to build upon and extend the existing work in three significant ways: a. First, it will extend the range of contexts through which existing frameworks and instruments devised by Phillips et al (2014) are used and evaluated, in particular, projects that involve families. This will enhance the robustness of such approaches; b. Second, it will examine not only the learning outcomes of citizen science projects, but also the processes through which that learning occurs and its contribution to the building of science capital (Archer et al 2012). This willhelp in establishing better understanding of not only what is learnt but also how learning occurs; c. Third, it will draw upon existing learning theories, such as those associated with experiential and intergenerational learning to develop a better theory of informal science learning through citizen science. This will advance knowledge in informal science learning. This project will enable the synthesis of research in learning theory and citizen science to build new directions for practice, research and theory in relation to informal science learning. It will enable the development of improved methodologies to evaluate the impact of citizen science specifically and informal science learning more generally. It will enable the further development of partnerships between researchers in learning and the sciences, practitioners in citizen science and volunteers, and the building of research capacity in informal science learning. The instrumental impacts of the project are to develop pedagogical models and evaluation tools that can enhance and support the learning of science in informal contexts, especially for youth. The conceptual impact will be to enhance theoretical development in the field of informal science learning. Thecapacity building impact will arise from the interactions of cross-disciplinary researchers and practitioners. Specific broader impacts from the project are specified under Project design and Management.",47029,09/09/2014,University of Stirling,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
"Brainstorm: Adolescent Brain Development Play and Project Islington Community Theatre / Blakemore Lab, University College London.","Brainstorm is a new theatre project exploring teenagers relationship with the science of adolescent brain development.  It is based on a successful pilot that ICT undertook in February/March 2013 and will be led collaboratively by professional theatre directors and Professor Sarah- Jayne Blakemore and her colleagues at the Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience (DCN) Lab at University College London. Brainstorm will use theatre as a unique platform for young people and neuroscientists to explor e adolescent brain development in a way in which, through dialogue, the participants inform the science as much as the other way round.  At the heart of the project is the creation of a new professional quality play called Brainstorm, performed by young people to 1,500 other young people and their parents at the Unicorn Theatre.  We will also produce an online film of the play, a guide for other young people to make their own version of the play and a joint TED Talk with Professor Blakemore  at the Royal Albert Hall. The play will be created through a series of research and development workshops with 120 young people in which we will explore how adolescent brain development as described by scientists is interpreted by adolescents in relation to their own experiences.  Through this we will find new ways of communicating the science and impact of brain development that will be incorporated into the play and, ultimately, provide neuroscientists with fresh perspectives to provoke new  scientific questions based on the responses of both the workshop participants and audiences.",29460,05/02/2014,Islington Community Theatre,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Community

The Open Source Brain repository: enabling the collaborative development of open and accessible models for neuroscience,"Computational modelling is important for understanding how brain function and dysfunction emerge from lower level neurophysiological mechanisms. Unfortunately, computational neuroscience has been hampered by poor accessibility, transparency, validation and reuse of models. The Open Source Brain (OSB) repository (beta version: http://www.opensourcebrain.org) will address these issues by providing resources that are absent in conventional model databases. By defining models in a standardised forma t, OSB will automatically expose their detailed properties and metadata in a transparent and accessible form. OSB will also provide the software infrastructure required to collaboratively develop and critically evaluate models, ranging from abstract cell and network models to detailed 3D microcircuits and brain regions. To do this we will combine advanced open source technologies for tracking, annotating and combining models developed across research teams with software for building, validat ing, visualising, simulating and analysing models. This will build on our previous work developing tools for model construction (www.neuroconstruct.org) and a widely used standardised model description language (www.NeuroML.org).

Extension Funding,"Our vision for this project is to provide exciting opportunities for sixth form   students to become biomedical researchers and, more importantly a model that   can be emulated in other schools. Authentic Biology will replicate the   successful MBP2 project in four locations in England, involving 300 sixth   formers experiencing real genetics research and 20 teachers as supervisors. School science is often criticised for not reflecting how research takes   place in the laboratory, whilst subject-specific teacher CPD remains a luxury   for most. At Simon Langton Grammar School we have challenged both these views through successfully piloting a programme of student-led research under the   stewardship of teachers, specially trained in the molecular techniques. MBP2   (Myelin Basic Protein Project) comprises some 95 Year 12 and 13 students, who   working in teams, have employed biochemistry and molecular biology research   methods to explore the chemical nature of the structurally fragile protein   MBP, responsible for the development of Multiple Sclerosis in some   individuals. Following our successful pilot, funded through Wellcome Trust   People Awards, we are seeking to expand the potential of MBP2-style projects   to become embedded in the biology experience of sixth form students and the   professional learning of teachers in each of the participating schools,   initially in schools in four regions in England. Our vision is that Authentic   Biology will remodel biology education to make it stimulating for students   whilst also offering valuable CPD enhanced training opportunities for   teachers and providing valuable experience for university thinking and   teaching. Simon Langton will draw on its experience and in-house expertise to   work with schools and university research scientists to lead this novel   approach in the four regions. Expected outcomes include: 1. Inspired and   knowledgeable sixth-form students 2. A cadre of biology teachers well-versed   in current laboratory techniques and confident to apply these to their   teaching 3. Sustained relationships between schools and university   departments 4.

Moving health and sustainability upstream into strategic urban development decision-making,"Working with landowners and developers using live large-scale urban development projects as case studies, and quantifying external costs from associated health impacts using economic valuation, we will explore the barriers and opportunities for integrating health outcomes, focusing in particular on upstream decision-making. Urban development is based predominantly on short time horizons (<5yrs), whether business-led e.g. from land acquisition through to sale of development units - or administrative term in political office. Even when business timelines are longer - e.g. when asset managers consider longer-term maintenance and investment decisions (<30yrs) - long-term health impacts are considered only reactively. There is currently no capacity for integrating an acceptable valuation mechanism for longer-term societal impacts into investment decisions early on. This project will attempt to fill this gap by bridging two otherwise isolated disciplines: long-term public health and short-term business decision making within the urban environment. Key goals: 1.

 _焉People like you_验: contemporary figures of personalisation,"We aim to contribute to critical medical humanities by investigating an emergent culture of personalisation in the UK, associated concepts of the person and health. We expect to stimulate debate on personalised medicine by showing how it can be understood more fully in relation to other personalising practices and how features shared across this broad field are consequential for our wellbeing. Our innovative figural approach will be applied to case studies of both top-down and open-ended practices of personalisation in medicine, data science and digital culture. In collaboration with creative consultants, we will conduct practice-led research to produce additional insight into the role of participation in, and the sense made of, personalisation. Our aim is to put the _焉person_验 back into personalisation, and relate such persons to the data collected from them and on their behalf. This approach will allow us to investigate individuals_验 sense of self, agency and identification with others. It will allow us to consider the implications of new techniques for stratifying _焉persons_验 precisely in shaping health outcomes and healthcare priorities. In sum, we will assess whether personalising practices, considered together, are influencing taken-for-granted concepts of the person with consequences for individual and collective health.  ",612204,01/02/2017,"Goldsmiths, University of London",The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Improving neonatal health in remote rural areas in China and Vietnam.,"Newborn (first 4 weeks of life) health remains a significant problem in China and Vietnam, especially in rural areas where they are 3 to 4 times more likely to die than in more developed areas. Most newborns can be treated with cost-effective interventions at facility and community levels, which do not require high-level training or costly equipment. Achieving high coverage of these interventions in the poorest areas could reduce neonatal deaths by at least 70%. While NH practice guidelines exist in China and Vietnam at national and local levels to guide on appropriate care and treatment, a major problem is ineffective implementation of the guidelines. This development study will assess the feasibility of using a participatory problem-solving intervention with local health managers to improve NH guideline implementation. If feasible, it will inform the design of a full-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. In the full-scale study, the research team would support local health managers through problem-solving and planning workshops, mentoring and capacity development to (1) assess the effectiveness of current guidelines; (2) identify barriers to improved implementation relating to service delivery (e.g. workforce issues, transport, equipment and supplies) and service demand (limited by remote access and traditional beliefs); (3) develop feasible strategies within current resource constraints e.g. re-organising services and the workforce, and using suitable community engagement models to stimulate demand for improved services; and 4) develop appropriate methods to monitor impact and unintended consequences. To assess the intervention's feasibility in remote, rural China and Vietnam the development study must address 4 questions: 1. What are the current health service management practices and the degree of freedom for decision-making at different systems levels for improving NH outcomes? 2. What are the opportunities for developing or strengthening community actions to support improved NH outcomes? 3. What is the potential for monitoring NH outcomes and measuring cost-effectiveness of interventions at different health systems levels? 4. What is the feasibility for local managers to use a participatory problem-solving intervention to implement existing practice guidelines for improving NH outcomes covering community, primary and referral levels and what would be the best vehicle for the intervention? We plan to conduct desk-based reviews of NH practice guidelines, challenges of monitoring NH impact in remote areas and NH intervention cost-effectiveness, before holding a 2-day workshop in Beijing to refine our field work plan and data collection tools and conduct 3 national key informant interviews (KIIs). We will then collect data in Guizhou, China using 4 methods: (i) KIIs: community level representatives, local health service managers, frontline health workers and provincial level policy makers and senior health officials; (ii) focus group discussions: recent mothers and community members; (iii) document review of community action agreements and provincial/national policies and plans; (iv) observation of health management information systems (HMIS) and accounting systems. A smaller research team will repeat this data collection protocol in Tay Nguyen, Vietnam, before analysing the two country datasets. This will inform the design the full-scale study and facilitate stakeholder engagement. We will produce 3 outputs on monitoring NH services in remote areas; practicalities of monitoring NH in remote China and Vietnam; and national policy space and local decision making freedom to improve NH services. Three levels of stakeholders will benefit: local (health service managers and staff), national (policy makers in China's MCH centres and Vietnam's NH technical working group) and international (e.g. Unicef, WHO, PMNCH and implementation science groups like WHO-led Implementation Research Platform).",22882,25/03/2014,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship,"Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.(Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) I aspire to a world where science is driven by social justice and powered by inclusive, equitable and culturally relevant research; but feel structures that continue to exclude under-represented groups from the change process, delay this.  People engage with science when their values, culture and circumstances, are taken into account. Marginalised groups don_验t have alternative choice. Treating people who are situated differently, as if they were the same, can result in much greater inequities (John Powell, Haas Institute). In the future these blind spots would not exist and cultural competency would be the norm. I'd like to see community-generated aspirations feeding a collective vision for scientific engagement, guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG_验s). This future is achievable, but requires investment and buy-in. I want to help stimulate this, but can_验t do it on my own; I need a vehicle.  We are Beginning to see changes here and around the world, for example, Iv_验e seen Minority-led science organisations, supported by Foundations and industry, such as Apple and Google, but we_验re behind on this in the UK. subsequently, deprived groups are being further disadvantaged by a system of engagement that functions without them. Government funding for science comes from a wide tax base. Every citizen, therefore, has a right to shape its development and share in its advances. In his article for the Guardian (July 2016) Imran Khan highlighted the issue of under-represented groups in science and the corresponding disparities, suggesting a collective responsibility for the lack of taking this into account. He also asked whether the sector was doing enough to make British science as diverse as Britain itself? I would extend this by asking whether the engagement sector, including funders and those responsible for hiring teams, are doing enough to diversify its own piece of the sector? With exception of the BSA and Royal Society, I_验m often unable to access science engagement conferences and events (except as a cased study) due to not being employed in the sector and no funding to pay. Student discounts exist but rarely for those on the margins. My vision recognises and gives all players a seat at the table and opportunity to advance the agenda. Fellowships are the ultimate leveller, particularly for non-traditional groups. The WCMT and RSA Fellowships require no qualification or professional grouping to access, just a well defined purpose, creativity, and action potential. To have such organisations invest in my potential has been a powerful motivator and courage builder, especially as I_验m venturing out on my own.

Enhancing the cryo-electron microscopy capacity at Imperial College London for single particle and tomographic studies.,"Electron microscopy (EM), especially cryo-EM single particle analysis technique, has become increasingly powerful in studying large macromolecular machines, due to the development in providing increasingly higher resolution structural information of large transient macromolecular complexes including the capability of capturing multiple functional states. The realization that many important macromolecular complexes are transient and intrinsically dynamic makes them not amenable to study by well-e stablished structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography. Cryo-EM, on the other hand, requires relatively small amount of samples and can capture transient and distinct functional and conformational states. With the development of algorithms that deal with heterogeneous populations within samples, cryo-EM single particle analysis becomes the ideal method for studying the complex dynamics of many key macromolecular machines. Furthermore, the ability to image organelles and sections  of a cell at high resolution will enable the investigations of individual macromolecular complexes to be placed in a cellular environment, thus bridging structural molecular biology with cell biology and physiology. To achieve this, we need a modern high resolution and high sensitivity electron microscope that is capable of obtaining high quality data in an automated fashion.",533538,22/05/2012,Imperial College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research

"Before HIV: Homosex and Venereal Disease, c.1939-1984.","The proposed research intends to explain the factors which led to increased concerns in the Anglo-American world regarding venereal disease (VD) transmission amongst men who had sex with men (MSM). It will cover from the Second World War - during which several journal articles warned health-care workers to be alert for 'undiscovered' signs of VD amongst homosexuals - to 1984, the year in which a virus was widely acknowledged to cause AIDS, a condition affecting many MSM. The research intends  to: (i) reconfigure the history of VD by focusing on MSM, a group which has largely been excluded from the historiography; (ii) link scholarship exploring the social surveillance of homosexuality to work on disease surveillance; (iii) counter-balance a whiggish historiography of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender interactions with science and medicine; and (iv) anchor the historiography of HIV/AIDS in a broader periodisation, demonstrating how early responses to the epidemi c emerged from trends beginning decades before. The project will use archival sources (public-health and venereology records, and those of homophile/gay rights organisations) and oral-history interviews to contextualise the remarkable shift that occurred during this period, where VD was transformed from being a problem primarily affecting heterosexuals to one increasingly associated with MSM.",151122,13/06/2012,University of Cambridge,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellow,"I believe my combination of experience, expertise and aspiration makes me an ideal candidate for one of the first Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowships. As the attached . CV illustrates, I have completed many highly-praised engagement projects in the medical humanities, collaborating with artists, scientists, historians and other specialists, and working extensively with the Wellcome Trust, Wellcome Collection -and other national and international .organisations. My parallel careers in academic history of medicine and engagement have enabled me to develop two fundamental sets of skills in this context: first, research and analysis to identify major themes, questions and stories; and. second, interpretation and presentation to open conversations with a range of audiences in a vivid, thought-provoking way.Building on this experience, as an Engagement Fellow I will develop and carry out insightful and innovative  engagement  projects  in  several media, inspired by my own  interests and  by  the Wellcome Trust's Research Challenges. These will raise the profile of the medical humanities at local and national levels, bringing together the public, students and researchers from across the biomedical sciences and medical humanities, and enabling me to develop a position as a leading figure in engagement across this field.A number of successful academic partnerships, from UCL's Department of Archaeology to the Cambridge  Health  and  Welfare Research Group,  have  led  me  to  appreciate  the  value  of interdisciplinary work. Building on this, I will work with other Engagement Fellows to create new initiatives which encourage specialists in biomedicine and the medical humanities to work together, both  to  enhance  their own work  and to increase public understanding  of  these  potent  and fascinating disciplines. In particular, I will work to create a community of Wellcome-funded students and  researchers with skills  in  engagement  and  collaboration between the  arts, sciences  and humanities. ",139200,23/06/2011,Misc Greater London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Individual

WONDERMIND,"Wondermind will reach new audiences not normally engaged with biomedical science by delivering a highly interactive and immersive website for children aged 8-12 and their parents, carers and teachers, which will introduce them to key neuroscience concepts in child development. They will learn about the science of brain development, inspired by works from the Tate collection and an exploration of the world presented by Lewis Carroll. The website will stimulate interest, excitement and debate about biomedical science through three main areas: 1. A series of mini-games, which will use art and ?Alice in Wonderland? themes to introduce our areas of scientific focus in a friendly and engaging way. The mini-games will be designed so that players acquire some basic information about the science of brain development through their play. 2. A set of interactive videos that link with the mini-games, but delve deeper into the science, with interviews with leading scientists and researchers. The interactive nature of the video will give the feeling of having a conversation with the expert. 3. The website itself, which holds all the content together and allows users to navigate and find information to support the scientific themes explored in the mini games and videos, linking out to further information where relevant and necessary. There will be polls and areas of the site that allow both children and adults to feed back on issues raised by the content, to encourage new ways of thinking about biomedical science. There will be lesson plans for Art and Science curricula at KS2 to support the use of Wondermind in the classroom. Wondermind will be launched with the forthcoming ?Alice in Wonderland?

"Tackling insecticide resistance in the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus: developing new molecular diagnostic tools, understanding the evolution of resistance and its impact on control interventions.","Insecticide-based interventions, notably Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs), are critical for malaria control in Africa. The recent rapid selection of resistance to the available insecticides classes in the major malaria vector Anopheles funestus across Africa is threatening the continued effectiveness of these control tools. The international community has now recognised that if suitable resistance management strategies to preserve the efficacy of current i nsecticides are not developed, this resistance will have devastating public health consequences. Unfortunately, important knowledge gaps on resistance (molecular basis, evolution and fitness cost) and the lack of adequate molecular tools to track resistance are preventing the design and implementation of suitable resistance mitigation strategies. To fill these gaps, I aim in this project to improve the control of An. funestus Africa-wide, by detecting molecular markers to track resistance, by el ucidating patterns of evolution and spread of resistance and assessing the fitness cost of resistance and its impact on control interventions. The project has three broad aims: Aim 1: To establish molecular markers and user-friendly diagnostic assays for pyrethroid, DDT and carbamate resistance and cross-resistance in An. funestus Africa-wide using Next-Generation Sequencing and functional analyses. Aim 2: To predict the evolution and spread of resistance by defining patterns of gene flow and se lective sweeps in field populations. Aim 3: To assess the fitness cost of resistance and its impact on control interventions using experimental huts trials. This project will benefit from the knowledge and tools generated during my Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship.",1855897,10/07/2013,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,The Wellcome Trust,,N,sports and fitness,Research
A preclinical magnetic resonance imaging system for neurology and oncology.,"This application is for a high-field (9.4T), preclinical MRI scanner. The key objective of the proposal is to increase the capacity for preclinical MRI at UCL, in order to support a research programme focussing on excellence in neuroscience and oncology. Currently, access to preclinical MRI at the UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI) is limited to a single scanner, which was funded in 2008 by the British Heart Foundation to develop cardiac imaging. This system is used at full cap acity and is typically booked up to three months in advance. Many requests that the Centre receives for collaborative research cannot currently be facilitated, despite their potential for scientific excellence and for generating novel, highly impacting results, or must be tailored to the constraints of the currently available infrastructure. If funded, this proposal would enable cutting-edge research projects (including research into neurodegeneration, optogenetics and non-invasive tumour his topathlogy) to be undertaken robustly and without compromise.

Why You'll Never Catch Smallpox - JAMES film primary school outreach.,"A unique and innovative project to create a free package of teaching materials for primary schools to accompany JAMES, a short drama film funded by the Wellcome Trust, based on Edward Jenner's discovery of the smallpox vaccination. Led by the film's producers and the Association for Science Education, the project will bring together an exciting combination of organisations and individuals including filmmakers, science education professionals, pharmaceutical scientists, and museums to develop  and trial a package of engaging teaching resources for Key Stage 2. Focusing on biomedical science but also covering mathematics, literacy, history, art and ethics, these materials will support science- and project-based work inspired by the film and its themes. The six-week topic will give children an awareness of the importance of Jenner's discovery, an understanding of the scientific processes and methods he used, and of how they have been developed in modern medical science and vaccine tr ials. The resources will be designed to enable teachers to approach Jenner's discovery through the new 'working scientifically' area of the national curriculum science programme of study in England (with flexibility in the design to be relevant throughout the UK). Recognising that primary teachers often lack confidence in teaching science, the resources will be designed to give teachers greater confidence and experience to teach these aspects of science in the longer term.

We will generate new methodology, algorithms and software tools for integrated modelling and analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data: specifically, structural MRI, diffusion MRI, resting/task functional MRI and MEG. Key technical goals are: parcellation of the brain into functional and structural units, and alignment of brain structure and function across multiple subjects, in both cases ut ilizing all modalities simultaneously; modelling of structural and functional networks in the brain that mediate information flow; developing multivariate classification and probabilisitic parametric atlases using structural, functional and network information, to develop biomarkers and investigate disease mechanisms. To maximize practical impact we will be translating these methods into user-accessible, well-supported software tools for both basic and clinical neuroimaging scientists worldwide.",2051501,17/04/2012,University of Oxford,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Development of light and electron microscopy facilities at University of Sheffield.,"In order to understand biological processes, it is necessary to be able to visualize individual components in their natural cellular, tissue or organismal environment.  The aim of this proposal is to facilitate such visualization by developing new electron microscopy approaches within the Electron Microscopy (EM) Facility and maintaining and further developing the Wellcome-funded Light Microscopy Facility (LMF) at the University of Sheffield. The LMF is a multiuser facility that provides access  to confocal microscopy which is widely used to study biological processes in living and fixed tissues. Our existing confocals are heavily used and usage is predicted to increase in the next year. One instrument is greater than eleven years old and one aim of this application is to replace it so that our users' requirements may be accommodated. Our current EM facility allows the sectioning of tissues and cells embedded in resin and sectioned at room temperature. While this provides us with usefu l ultrastructural details of cells, it is not usually compatible with antibody-labelling of molecular components. We are therefore requesting funds for freeze substitution equipment that will enable us to perform immunogold labelling of specific proteins in samples with well-preserved morphology.",175133,14/10/2010,University of Sheffield,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Cardboard Citizens presents: Meta.,"Theatre company Cardboard Citizens and a team of cognitive neuroscientists will collaborate to educate and excite 2,000 young people about the development of their brains, and the potential impact this has on their thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Following a period of R&D with young people (aged 13-16) and teachers in East London secondary schools, we will work with a professional creative team, including playwright Sarah Woods and 5 young actors, to create an original piece of Forum Theatre  entitled Meta.  Meta will combine original, contemporary sound design and digital artistry, lecture-style neuroscience insights and live, interactive theatre to present the story of a teenager facing difficult life circumstances. Post-show forums will support audience members, in light of their new knowledge, to think differently about the situations presented in the play, and try alternative strategies out onstage. Metas project team proposes that, in this way, Forum Theatre could facilitate  the development of metacognition (the ability to think about ones own thoughts) and emotional regulation strategies in our audiences  adolescents. Meta will tour to up to 20 East London education providers and reach a further 500 members of public through theatre showcases, increasing audience understanding of, and capacity to think differently about, adolescent experience. A thorough evaluation, led by the Neuroscience team, will test Forum Theatre as an artistic tool to support the develop ment of metacognition and emotional regulation in adolescents aged 13-16. An original educational toolkit will support the continued creative education of neuroscience within participating schools.",91621,30/07/2015,Cardboard Citizens,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Company
A novel biomarker platform for dementia research with single molecule sensitivity.,"Identification of biomarkers is increasingly important in diagnosis and therapeutic decision making in most areas of medicine and particularly so in neurological conditions due to difficulties of direct visualisation and tissue sampling of the central nervous system. Biomarkers are also critically important for clinical trial inclusion criteria and as outcome measures. Sensitive methods to measure markers are constantly sought and in clinical neuroscience cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is one of the  most promising biomarker matrices, although CSF volumes are often limited and not easily resampled. Biomarkers in CSF are at low concentration and so are not easily measured. A key objective is to develop novel biomarkers for core neuropathological changes in neurological diseases using ultrasensitive Simoa technology. The equipment requested is a fully automated analyser manufactured by Quanterix , the Simoa HD-1. Simoa (single molecule array) technology is based on standard immunochemical tec hniques and uses paramagnetic beads and standard reagents but is able to achieve much greater sensitivity than standard techniques due to the ability to trap single molecules in femtolitre volume wells allowing for a digital readout. measuring at the single molecule level. This can lead to up to 1000-fold better analytical sensitivity, compared to traditional ELISA techniques.",119531,11/06/2015,University College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
EMPOWER: Empowering people affected by Mental disorders to Promote Wider Engagement with Research,"Despite the growing research evidence on the burden of mental disorders and the cost-effectiveness of treatments for mental disorders, the 'treatment gaps' remain very large in developing countries. One of the major barriers in facilitating the scaling up of services is the marginalised voices of people affected by mental disorders and the limited capacity of groups representing them (?user organizations?) to articulate positions based on science. The aim of this proposal is to strengthen the capacity of user organizations in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to utilise research findings to develop a plan for engagement with the wider community to improve the understanding of the nature and treatment of mental disorders and reduce the pervasive INT ENGAGEMENT AWARD FORM 01/08 Page 6 of 23 stigma associated with these conditions. This project will achieve its objectives through a series of linked activities: participation of each user organization in the annual Leadership in Mental Health course in Goa, India in November 2010 where the participants will interact with researchers and practitioners to develop the key messages for the communication strategy; developing the communication strategy around these key messages, contextualised for each setting; increasing the acceptability of the Movement for Global Mental Health (MGMH) website, and the partner organization web-sites, for non-professional audiences, with technical support from web-design experts; and dissemination of the communication strategies through the websites and presentation at the Global Mental Health Summit in Cape Town in October 2011.

The Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE).,"This proposal concerns the extension of the Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE) at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) with PRIDE-plus: a high-quality subset of curated data from the PRIDE repository for mass spectrometry based proteomics data. Building on the outstanding achievements of the large-scale genome sequencing projects, the field of mass spectrometry based proteomics has grown considerably over the past few years. Correspondingly, PRIDE has also experienced an increas ing expansion, especially with the field now considering data sharing essential to publishing their findings. This trend of growing data deposition is likely to continue since PRIDE has become the primary submission portal for mass spectrometry data in the ProteomExchange Consortium. The experimental data stored in PRIDE is currently of varying quality, and differs in its degree of annotation. To solve this heterogeneity, we propose to extract the most valuable and well-annotated data from PRID E and store it in a high-quality subsection called PRIDE-plus. A proteome library interface will be built on top of PRIDE_plus that will enable users from across the life sciences to navigate this wealth of complex data. The ultimate goal of PRIDE-plus will thus be to serve the life sciences community as an important source of spatio-temporal proteomics data.",1176396,10/07/2008,Embl At Hinxton,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Towards agri-system thinking: An integrated approach to problems of modern livestock production.,"This project aims to produce an ambitious plan of work to address problems of livestock health, productivity, welfare and the environment which are commonly associated with intensive farming. In contrast to previous studies, which examine these problems in isolation, it will break new ground by focussing upon the nature and dynamics of the agricultural systems that give rise to them. This approach is essential if we are to confront the threats that these problems pose to food security, ecologica l sustainability, animal well-being and the public acceptability of modern livestock farming. Led by scholars from history, social science and epidemiology, the project will span the historical emergence and characterisation of these problems, their present-day manifestations, and how they might evolve in future under a drive for sustainable intensification. There will be two facilitated workshops, bringing together stakeholders and scholars from a range of backgrounds for a frank exchange of vi ews on these problems, the deficiencies that exist in their understanding, management, governance and communication, and how these could be addressed through an integrated, inter-disciplinary program of work. The core team will use these discussions as a basis for drafting a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award application and two publications.",27825,08/04/2015,King's College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
"Neurobiology of speech communication:cognition, plasticity and social interactions","Functional imaging studies (PET and fMRI) have revealed that human speech is processed along distinct (though interacting) streams, in ways that are analogous to the functional and anatomical auditory streams seen in animal primate studies. I am proposing a series of studies in which aspects of human speech perception and production are investigated, to identify the neural basis of low level and higher-order control of speech perception, the neural basis of production and perception of speech in different masking contexts, and plasticity and individual differences in speech processing. I am particularly interested in how we can apply these results to the understanding of clinical issues (e.g. aphasic stroke and cochlear implantation), and will address the latter with studies of cochlear implant users and simulations. I also aim to extend this work to consider how the importance of social factors, such as how communicative intent affects the neural regions recruited in addition to those involved in the linguistic processing of speech. This is an attempt to integrate the neurobiology of speech perception and production with themes in social neuroscience, and important link to establish, given the central role of speech as a communication tool.",311157,03/12/2014,University College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

The 1958 Birth Cohort Biomedical Resource - Facilitating access to data and samples and enhancing future utility. (bridge funding).,"This infrastructural project is targeted at strategic development of that component of the 1958 Birth Cohort(1958BC) that is known as the ""Biomedical Resource"". It will ensure that optimum utility can be extractedfrom the Resource during 2011-2014 and that the 1958BC will then be well placed to maintain and extend itsinternationally hailed contribution to research in the biomedical and social sciences. The proposal subsumesthree complementary objectives: (1) secure the basic infrastructure as it now exists, thus ensuring that thesuccessful systems that have already been implemented can be maintained into the future; (2) enhance theinfrastructure from an administrative and strategic management perspective to ensure that it can faceexpected and unexpected future challenges and opportunities both effectively and resiliently; (3) enhance theinfrastructure from a scientific perspective to ensure that both the 1958BC, and UK Bioscience, are bestplaced to face the scientific challenges of the future. The new science underpinning this application isfocused entirely on optimising and enhancing the utility of the pre-existing Biomedical Resource _研 theproposal contains no hypothesis-driven research and no funding is sought for additional data or samplecollection from study participants. The responsibility for strategic development of the cohort as a whole _研including planning for future data sweeps - will remain with the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). Thisapplication reflects a considered evolution in the thinking of the funders (MRC, WT, ESRC) about strategicdevelopment of the 1958BC Biomedical Resource and of the systems and policies governing access to it.Initially, responsibility for access and strategic development lay with the Principal Investigators of theoriginal grant. But, it later became clear that if resource utility was to be optimised it should be managed anddeveloped by independent scientists and administrators. In 2008, responsibility for managing the 1958BCbiobank therefore transferred to ALSPAC laboratories at the University of Bristol under a joint grant fromMRC/WT. Then, in 2009, responsibility for oversight and strategic development of the Biomedical Resourceas a whole passed to the independent access committee chaired from the University of Leicester underanother small grant from MRC/WT. Following strategic discussions with MRC, WT and ESRC, theUniversity of Leicester and University of Bristol now outline a vision for joint management of the BiomedicalResource, to include its strategic development as an infrastructure, under a grant requesting limited - butadequate - funding to ensure sustainability.",29938,20/07/2015,University of Leicester,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Research towards an MA Module in Participative Practice/Environmental Art,"ArtWorks funding has been awarded to The Stove Network to undertake initial research towards developing an MA module in Environmental and Participative Practice. The Stove Network will work with an existing informal network of other place-based arts projects in Scotland and Wales as part of their research.  As well as informing the longer term development of a MA module, they plan, though their engagement with other rural place based partners, to strengthen this informal grouping and share their research at the end of the process.  This research will be jointly run with the University of West Scotland as their academic partner (pending match funding from the Innovation Voucher Scheme).  This funding will enable The Stove Network the research the feasibility of developing a formal training offer as part of their longer term business plan.The Stove Network is an artist led collective based in a disused three story former shop in the town centre of Dumfries with a membership of circa 200 people ranging from international artists to emerging artists and students.  Their core mission is about breathing new life into the town using art and creativity and actively involving local people.  They are particularly interested in exploring how they can create a sustainable business model for both the building and the wider network. Part of this is exploring the feasibility of setting up an MA module that would be run through the Stove Network and provide academic institutions a residential course for students to study environmental and socially engaged practice.  This would offer employment for their network members, bring new artists into the area to cross fertilize with the existing artist community and potentially offer a sustainable business model in the longer term. ",3500,17/06/2015,The Stove Network Ltd,Paul Hamlyn Foundation,Dumfries and Galloway,N,environment,Charity

Life Boost Cafe - improve your life one cup at a time,"This will be an extension of the Falkirk Food Buddies project. The current project involves setting up peer support for older people in Falkirk around issues with food. This project would allow us to expand the service to incorporate more issues, using food as an incentive, a mechanism for forging relationships, a learning tool and confidence builder. We would run a drop in self-help sessions in the West of Falkirk Council Area for people over 50 on low incomes. This part of the demographic makes up 24% of all people claiming unemployment benefits in Falkirk. West of Falkirk is recognised as a cold spot for support services and recent bus routes cancellations made it even harder for people to access the support they need. The self-help sessions will be facilitated by a paid worker and will address issues faced by the participants. When necessary, an outside representative may be brought in, to provide relevant information- for example welfare advice or Mental Health 1st Aid training. This project offers us a chance to work in partnership with other local organisations, such as Falkirk District Association for Mental Health and local Citizens Advice Bureau. The sessions will be initially led by the worker, but the participants will be encouraged to take an equally active role, eventually taking over the running of the sessions once the funded period ends. This way the project should become sustainable. Food will be available at each session to encourage participation and to spread the message about the importance of food, both as a source of nutrition and as a way of connecting with other people. Some of the food will need to be prepared by the participants, as a way of increasing confidence and skills around food and as a way of augmenting social connections between them.",5000,02/12/2016,Outside The Box Development Support Limited,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,Glasgow ,N,elderly,Charity

Functional architectures in the brain.,"Our computational neuroscience programme has progressed at two levels:  First, we have had considerable success in modelling observed brain responses using biologically plausible models of neuroimaging data.  We can now model fMRI, EEG and MEG responses with neural mass models of distributed networks to estimate population dynamics, synaptic efficacy and receptor function.  More importantly, we can compare different models using Bayesian model comparison to test competing hypotheses about underl ying functional architectures.  The second line of work addresses the basic constraints under which open, self-organising biological systems like the brain operate.  This work has led to a formulation (a free-energy principle), that places the Bayesian brain in the larger context of exchange with the environment.  This formulation provides a unified account of action and perception and, within perception, perceptual inference, learning and attention.  We would now like to bring these two lines o f work together and use neural mass models of empirical data to identify how the free-energy principle is instantiated in neuronal circuits.

Functional characterisation of novel Legionella pneumophila type IV secretion system effector proteins.,"L. pneumophila is the etiological agent of Legionnaires' disease, which is an acute form of pneumonia. Although L. pneumophi/a is an environmental organism, its ability to survive and replicate in amoebae, such as Acanthamoeba castellanii, has equipped the organism with the capacity to replicate in human cells. Following the inhalation of aerosols containing L. pneumophila into the human lung, the bacteria are internalized by alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells where they replicate within an intracellular vacuole that avoids fusion with the endocytic pathway. L. pneumophila evades endosome fusion by establishing a replicative vacuole that shares many characteristics with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [1-3). The formation of the unique Legionella containing vacuole (LCV) requires the Dot (defective in organelle trafficking)/lcm (intracellular multiplication) type IV secretion system (T4SS) [4, 5], which translocates more than 150 bacterial effector proteins to the vacuolar membrane and cytosol of the host cell [6-19]. Many of the effector proteins comprise families of paralogues and the function for the vast majority of these proteins is unknown. Many effectors also share similarity with eukaryotic proteins. These are predicted to allow L. pneumophila to manipulate host cell processes by functional mimicry of eukaryotic proteins [8, 14, 20-24). Despite significant advances in our knowledge of L. pneumophila genomics and the cell biology of the L. pneumophila vacuole, our understanding of the interaction of specific Legionel/a virulence determinants with host cell proteins and the molecular basis of their mechanism of action is relatively superficial. In particular, the inactivation of genes encoding the T 4SS effectors rarely results in a major intracellular growth defect or any striking change in trafficking of the Legionel/a vacuole. This has led researchers to conclude that much functional redundancy exists among the T4SS substrates and the detection of protein function based on bacterial gene knockouts is unlikely to succeed in the majority of cases. Here we aim to develop an integrated approach to the study of virulence protein function that relies on biological screens to identify host cell interacting partners and eukaryotic structures, processes and signalling pathways that are affected by expression of the bacterial protein. We will ectopically express effector protein substrates of the T 4SS secretion system and study their localisation and their effect in transfected cells using specific markers allowing to monitor for cytoskeletal alterations (actin, microtubules) and organelle integrity (Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, lysosomes, peroxisomes, nucleus, mitochondria) . In addition, we will investigate the role of virulence proteins during infection by utilising technology to manipulate the host rather than the pathogen, such as RNA interference (RNAi) technology. Effectors for this proposal have been chosen based on preliminary results obtained in our laboratory from a recent new L. pneumophila genome sequence.",148654,15/07/2008,Imperial College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research

Community Welfare Reform Service,"The CWRS will be delivered in the Fullarton Area of Irvine. This area is to the West of Irvine separated by the river. It has a population of approx 4,500 and is mainly social housing and local authority and Irvine Housing Association. It has figured highly over the years in the Scottish Governments Index of Multiple Deprevation. Three streets within the area are in the top five. It is an area of high unemployment and long term unemployment and experiences poor health and low educational attianment. It has a large elderly population. We are a collection point for the First Alliance Credit Union and have nine trained volunteers. We are also a voucher distribution point for North Ayrshire Foodbank and provide a signposting service to a number of Third Sector Support Service and also have close working relationships with the Local Authority and NHS Ayrshire and Arran. We would like to purchase Ipads and load them with a range of support services and information that our volunteers can use when out and about. These would be updated regularly ensuring that the information/contacts given would be current. We would also utilise the Ipads to capture evaluative evidence and service user's feedback. Sessional hours will allow us to provide dedicated support and greater availability and access. We will be able to support the development of the volunteers over the 26 weeks which will allow us to have a pool of volunteers who can support over community in a range of ways and means.

"Molecular and developmental alterations in circadian clock function in various strains of the Mexican blind cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus.","A major environmental cue for most organisms is the daily cycle of light and darkness Consequently, most organisms have developed a system, synchronised by the light/dark cycle coordinating physiology and behaviour with the environment. This system is known as the circadian clock and was proposed to be a neural phenomenon residing in a region of the central nervous system: the SCN. Over the last decade, research has led to a decentralisation of the circadian clock with discoveries of independent peripheral oscillators both in vivo (Whitmore et al, 1998) and in vitro cell culture (Whitmore et al, 2000; Welsh et al, 2004). Additionally, zebrafish cells can detect light and use this to set the phase of the circadian clock. Recent research in our lab has begun to investigate the workings of the circadian clock in a species of fish that lives in perpetual darkness, and is therefore missing the major environmental cue for most living organisms. This work has been performed using the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus; a single teleost species consisting of a sighted surface-dwelling form and several independent cave dwelling forms. Cavefish have lost eyes and pigmentation, as well as gaining constructive feature: such as increased jaw size and taste bud number. Selective pressures for retaining light adaptive features such as pigmentation are relaxed in the absence of light, and it is believed that pigmentation is lost through neutral mutations in the Oca2 gene (Protas et al, 2006). Little research has been performed on circadian clocks in cave animals, and particularly not on cave animals with living con-specific surface dwelling ancestors. This is important because when the ancestral surface form is still present, a direct comparison can be made between ancestral and derived developmental states. Astyanax is thus an important model for understanding the molecular basis of developmental changes in the context microevolution. Jeffery suggested ""cavefish can be compared with surface fish in essentially the same way as mutants are compared with wild-type phenotypes"" (Jeffery, 2008). We possess a model in which we can investigate a range of clock phenotypes. We will use surface fish and the two different populations of cavefish (Pachon and Steinhard) in our proposed research to further understand clock mechanisms in a dark adapted animal and assess whether cavefish really are clock mutants. If they are mutants in the clock me",4680,29/03/2010,University College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Monocyte and Macrophage Heterogeneity in Venous Thrombus Resolution.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) affects 1-2% of the population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes during natural thrombus resolution led us to hypothesise that their activity may be important for this process. These cells are however a heterogeneous population with overlapping and contrasting functions. In vitro studies show that monocyte/macrophages display functional plasticity but whether this occurs in vivo is unclear. We do not  know whether specific monocyte subsets give rise to different macrophages phenotypes, or whether macrophages can change function in response to the tissue microenvironment. This study will use a model of inflammation driven tissue remodeling in which thrombus resolves by a process of organisation similar to that seen in man. We will develop monocyte specific reporter mice to investigate: sequential mobilisation of circulating monocyte subsets following thrombus induction; which subsets are rec ruited into the thrombus; the temporal pattern of their recruitment; and the fate of recruited monocytes. A better understanding of monocyte biology in this in vivo model may i) reveal novel therapeutic pathways that could be targeted when conventional therapies are contraindicated or ineffective and ii) facilitate the development of imaging agents that target specific monocyte/macrophage phenotypes in vivo.",311352,03/12/2009,King's College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
The Study of Tears.,"The Study of Tears is a science and art research and education project exploring why we cry led by Susan Norwood Artistic Director of Project Volume. The project will be realized through the use of video, photography and dance produced by pupils of Selly Oak Special Needs School, working under the guidance and tuition of professional artists and adviser Dr J M Tiffany. The participants, who have learning disabilities, will be placed at the core of creative and scientific learning. They will be their own learning consultants. Their exploratory, personal and creative response to the science of tears will be expressed through a multi-media performance, peer-to-peer learning, the production of an in-house video documentary, web-based publication and Blog. The medium of the video camera utilises, of course, a lens which has an affinity to the eye. Video will be a central medium in the project. The medium of dance will communicate the different emotional signals of tears. The primary objectives of the project are to stimulate a creative as well as an analytical approach to learning the science of tears, using multimedia art and dance to facilitate learning and communication among pupils who may struggle with traditional forms of learning.",30000,15/02/2010,Project Volume,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Charity
Politics and practice: The British Veterinary Association 1881-2009,"The proposed research is a continuation of a project started over a year ago to outline the key activities, interests and achievements of the British Veterinary Association from its foundation (as National Veterinary Medical Association) in 1881 to the present day. The Wellcome Trust's award to support this project has now terminated, so a 12-month extension is sought. The BVA is the representative body of the British veterinary profession. Its role is to promote veterinary interests to government, users of veterinary services and other stakeholders in animal health. (BVA, 2008 Throughout its history, it has aimed to reconcile differences of opinion within its diverse and often individualistic membership. Its changing structure and organization reflected shifts in veterinary roles and identities, while its publications and educational initiatives reveal the changing nature of veterinary knowledge and expertise. It therefore offers a unique window onto the history of the British veterinary profession. The goals of this project are: To produce a historical account of the BVA's organization, priorities, activities and relationships To provide insights into the broader history of veterinary medicine that will act as a basis for future, more detailed work on the history of veterinary science, practice, politics and expertise.

"SHEDS (Society Helping to Engage, Develop and Succeed)","SHEDS is aimed at older people within communities who are retired, socially isolated and looking for something purposeful to do or even to make new friends. We have had various conversations with the Tranent community, (by working in partnership with STRiVE Wellbeing) in East Lothian and people that reside here have reported that they would like to have a Shed that centred on different target audiences. For example, a Community Shed which would encompass a traditional Men_验s Shed, but also have capacity for intergenerational activities with younger men and youths too. This is a very different angle and approach to the traditional Men's Shed model that originated in Australia. Furthermore, the Shed would also be open to women in Tranent. This would be only the second Shed in Scotland to open it's doors to women. We believe that this will bring a dynamic where women can learn woodworking skills, be able to carry out different projects and increase their knowledge of different crafts. In turn, the men attending the shed will be able to pass on their knowledge but also learn a variety of different skills from the ladies in attendance. What we want to do: There are three areas that will be developed, and will be user led: 1. A Shed in Tranent will be set up and be based at The Heugh and will focus more on the health and wellbeing of the members; focusing on self-management and reducing social isolation. 2. Purchase a Shed for the members to build (which will give them their first project and allow them to customise it for their future use and projects.) 3.

"""Learning from Lister: Antisepsis, Safer Surgery and Global Health"" to be held KCL, Royal Society and Royal College of Surgeons on 22-24 March 2012","To celebrate the centenary of the death of Joseph Lister, we are planning a major multi-disciplinary conference which will re-examine the achievements of Lister in context, and explore Lister's legacy for surgery and healthcare today. Events will be held in three locations - King's College Strand Campus, the Royal College of Surgeons of England at Lincoln's Inn Fields, and the Royal Society at Carlton Terrace. Planning and development of the conference is being carried out by these three institutions together led from King's (see conference leaflet). The conference aims to provide a major forum for the examination and discussion of Lister's life, work and legacy. The major outcome will be the publication of a special edition of the Royal Society's Notes and Records journal, featuring articles on the conference, and new and original scholarship on Lister and the History of Medicine, Surgery and Bacteriology. There is currently an absence of major scholarly works on Lister's legacy, and the conference would be uniquely placed to generate intellectual outcomes to address this gap. We also aim to publish an edited volume arising from the conference, based on the papers, research and debate of the conference. There will be significant outcomes for the healthcare professionals who attend, both in understanding the historical principles behind current practice, and in re-evaluating modern surgical and antiseptic techniques. We aim for the conference to make a contribution to modern ideas of antisepsis and cleanliness within the healthcare environment, aligned with the third aim of the Wellcome Trust's strategic plan, ""Combating Infectious Disease"".

Croft IT,"The Croft IT project aims to reach out to crofters and smallholders of all ages in crofting areas throughout the Highland and Islands to bring them up to speed in the use of IT for everyday life.  Historically, uptake and willingness to use on line services has been poor within the crofting sector.  The advent of the 2015 Scottish Rural Development Programme has necessitated an increased demand for IT and digital coaching to help crofters and smallholders access agriculture support schemes and other services.      The crofting area comprise of Shetland, Orkney, Isle of Lewis, Isle of Harris, North Usit, Benbecula, South Uist, Eriskay, Isle of Barra, the small Isles, Isle of Mull, Isle of Bute, Isle of Skye, Isle of Arran, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross and Cromarty, Invernesshire, Argyll, Nairnshire and Morayshire. The majority of these areas are characterised by remoteness, rurality and isolation of population. Therefore the use of digital technology is essential for enhancing communication channels, knowledge transfer and bringing the world to their doorstep.     Training events will be promoted by Local Course Directors and held in local Village Hall, Community Centres etc.  The Scottish Crofting Federation is a charitable company which aims to:  * Develop, promote and support crofting livelihoods as a unique social system unified through small-scale food production;  * Represent and safeguard the interests of crofters, their communities, their cultural heritage, their moral and legislative rights;  * Promote the agricultural, social and environmental benefits of crofting as intrinsic to the development and maintenance of local rural economies;  * Raise awareness of crofting through information provision and education;  * Promote diversity and economic viability within crofting;  * Encourage, through training, crofting enterprise, skills and expertise;  * Is led by its membership in developing position on policy matters and works always using participative methodology;  * Seek the development of crofting as an important and valuable way of life.    SCF Training Team will be responsible for running the project.  With support from the fund we aim to purchase 15 iPad Air devices with tough cases to support outdoor and classroom based learning.     The iPad devices will be used to support digital inclusion amongst the crofting community and enable trainees to fully engage with data entry and capture for crofting. In addition the devices will also be used as teaching aids to foster apps relevant to crofting for example: the Hutton institute soil profiling app, cattle tag apps and digital mapping apps using GPS for croft mapping exercises.  In terms of innovation, the project aims to promote the use of IT and digital inclusion in crofting communities, some of which have never engaged with IT in this way before.

We will set a restaurant environment for our Friends with volunteer hosts on each table. The hosts will encourage and support Friends to participate in the conversations. Alongside loneliness, 80% of Friends are living in poverty. This means that they are often unable to afford a healthy and nutritional meal. Furthermore, as they have no one to cook for, many of our friends have told us that they eat sandwiches and cheap (usually unhealthy) snack food. Observations by our staff and volunteers at Wednesday Call-in Cafe have shown that the coffee and cake our Friends are served is the first meal of the day for many.

 Grand Challenge: Design for enhancing safety of life and property,"With generous support from Lloyd_验s Register Foundation, the Royal College of Art proposes leading a Grand Challenge for students under the theme of Enhancing Safety of Life and Property.The Challenge could specifically consider safety in one of the following industries: gas supply, nuclear power, or aerospace.Particular focus would be on people operating in stressful environments within the chosen industry. These are often characterised by highly complex hardware, software or equipment, and often rely on skilled and non-skill workers, as well as, in some cases, interaction with non-professionals (e.g. airline passengers).The focus of the Challenge would therefore be: how can design minimise risk and increase safety in these complex systems and stressful environments?A pre-Challenge period of research and set up will establish parameters. These will include selecting the focus industry, engaging academics and/or corporate partners, and fixing dates.The Challenge will be delivered in two phases. Phase One will involve intensive research. Students will be introduced to issues of safety and risk within the industry, through seminars, presentations from experts, site visits and identification of key safety and risk issues. By the end of this phase, entrants will be organised into teams led by Visiting Lecturers (VLs), generate initial ideas and develop these to proof-of-concept stage.A panel will select from these ideas to continue into Phase Two, where selected teams will develop their concepts and ideas in detail over four weeks.At the end, teams will give 10-minute presentations. These may include drawings, models, visuals or written materials.The RCA will write a report on the projects and the entire Challenge Event.

Large scale neuronal recording and stimulation,Several Wellcome Trust funded behavioural neuroscience research programmes at Oxford focus on systems neuroscience in anima lmodels. A general aim is to understand how brain regions within an interconnected network causally interact with each other at a neuronal level.  To do this one must employ both correlational (e.g. fMRI or neuronal recording) and intervention methods. Our current research programmes employ a maximum of 256 electrode channels (divided across several arrays placed over different areas) and our intervention methods include reversible inactivations and lesions.   This shared equipment grant will provide a new shared recording/stimulation lab containing state-of-the art equipment  capable of recording neurophysiological signals simultaneously from 1024 electrode channels and is also capable of providing direct brain stimulation via the implanted microelectrodes. This is necessary to facilitate three important advances:   (i) recording simultaneously from 1024 electrodes in more brain regions will allow us to investigate more inter-area interactions per animal (reducing time and animal numbers required to obtain such data).   (ii) introducing direct microstimulation via implanted micro-electrode arrays offers us an important new approach to analyse causal influences between brain regions.   (iii) allow simultaneous recordings from two socially interacting animals.,350000,16/06/2016,University of Oxford,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship 2012.,"The Wellcome Trust is widely recognised in the UK and internationally as the leading funder of innovative public engagement, inviting the public to explore big scientific challenges. Likewise, I have a reputation and passion for delivering innovative, high-quality public engagement across the interface of science, medicine and the humanities.Public engagement has an important role in achieving extraordinary improvements in human health and, as a pioneer who works with the public, including with some of the most deprived, yet creative communities in the UK, I can offer a considerable contribution to the Wellcome Trust Vision. Through my public engagement endeavours, I work responsively to cultural contexts and strive to forge trust in order to breakdown the barriers between researchers and the public. By way of example, my public engagement endeavours have connected non-English speaking communities at risk of disease and infection to work alongside researchers investigating associated biomedical diseases. These public engagement activities have transformed community members into advocates and translators of important health information.My experience and commitment to creativity, intellectual curiosity, professional development and organisational learning ensure I thrive as a Wellcome Trust Fellow. As a filmmaker and archive fanatic I was inspired by the Wellcome Library collection, with a game, Lost Cats Legacy, that caught the attention of Sheffield International Documentary Festival. I am excited by the public engagement possibilities of the digitised material from the Wellcome Library_验s collection and the prospect of support from Wellcome staff to unlock its creative potential.A Wellcome Fellowship would present considerable strategic added value by helping me to consolidate lessons from _焉networked_验 and citizen-led approach to public engagement that I am pursuing.

In collaboration with creative consultants, we will conduct practice-led research to produce additional insight into the role of participation in, and the sense made of, personalisation. Our aim is to put the _焉person_验 back into personalisation, and relate such persons to the data collected from them and on their behalf. This approach will allow us to investigate individuals_验 sense of self, agency and identification with others. It will allow us to consider the implications of new techniques for stratifying _焉persons_验 precisely in shaping health outcomes and healthcare priorities. In sum, we will assess whether personalising practices, considered together, are influencing taken-for-granted concepts of the person with consequences for individual and collective health.  ",396385,01/02/2017,Imperial College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Transforming brain recordings with next-generation probes,"Thanks to the Wellcome Trust and other leading international institutions, we have developed and proved the viability of a new generation of recording probes that will transform electrophysiology. These ""Neuropixels"" probes transcend past approaches, recording hundreds to thousands of neurons simultaneously. Several key steps are now necessary to maximize the impact of this new technology, enabling its widespread use in the neuroscience community. We must develop radically new recording equipment and software, provide training, and build a collaborative community of users (Aim 1). To allow this community to fully exploit the potential of this technology, we must extend it to a larger range of applications: multi-shank probes, wireless recording for freely moving animals, and optrodes for use with optogenetics (Aim 2). Meanwhile, we will obtain ground-truth data to calibrate error rates, and begin the development of a tool to automatically identify brain regions based on electrophysiological characteristics (Aim 3). This project integrates software and hardware engineering, fabrication efforts, neurophysiology tests, and behavioral and anatomical techniques. It thus requires a collaboration between laboratories with different skill sets, and a unique nanoelectronics research partner, IMEC. The results of this collaboration will transform the field of neuroscience.",1674199,30/11/2016,University College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

"Building resilient health systems: lessons from international, national and local emergency responses to the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone.","The response to the Ebola epidemic has challenged the dominant paradigm of gradual health systems strengthening, led by national governments and supported by international actors. It poses difficult questions about what kind of responses are helpful in situations when sudden shocks appear to overwhelm already fragile health systems and deplete limited resources. Over the last 12 months, the Ebola epidemic has revealed a lack of resilience in the health systems of affected countries, demonstrating an inability to recover from shocks and mount effective responses.We ask: In what ways has the international Ebola-response affected Sierra Leone's health system and its ability to withstand future shocks? How can international, national and local emergency response mechanisms be utilised to build a resilient health system in Sierra Leone, and what lessons emerge? Our findings will offer the potential to promote a major shift in the global health systems debate, from one narrowly focused on health system strengthening, to a focus on building health systems that are strong as well as resilient. The study will explore what needs to happen at each systems level, what capacities need to be created at local, district and national level, and what role international actors should play. To address these questions, we bring together a multidisciplinary team with extensive expertise in a range of highly relevant, but currently largely separate, bodies of scientific scholarship: health systems/health systems strengthening; policy and implementation science; disaster risk reduction/emergency preparedness; and the anthropology of global health and medical humanitarianism. Explicitly bringing together these often separate bodies of learning will enable us to more fully and effectively answer our principal research questions, identify transferable lessons and contribute to generating substantive health systems research evidence relating to what promotes resilient health systems.",167595,15/03/2016,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
The London Metallomics Facility,"Trace metals such as Fe, Cu and Zn have many key roles in living systems, e.g. in cell signaling, metalloenzymes, allosteric effectors and structural components in enzymes and electron-chain systems. Many diseases of major socioeconomic impact (dementia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease etc.) are associated with changes in levels and locations of trace metals. Moreover, contamination of water, soil, air and food by non-essential/toxic metals is a public health issue worldwide. In addition, metals are a key component in the design of many drugs (metallodrugs) and imaging agents (radiopharmaceuticals, MR contrast agents), both for therapy and diagnosis. The ability to measure the concentration and distribution of trace metals in the body and to map them spatially at the cellular and whole body level is therefore critically important. A facility to perform such measurements is urgently required in the UK. We propose a Metallomics Facility based at King_验s College and Imperial College that will: enable the present London consortium to study the roles of trace metal balance in health and disease, form a national hub of expertise and facilities for metal analyses in biological, especially human, samples, and develop an atlas of trace metal concentration, speciation and distribution in human health and disease.",390000,16/06/2016,King's College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,elderly,Research

Light sheet microscope for imaging of cell and developmental biology in health and disease,"The ability to image cells in 3 dimensions as they migrate, differentiate, form multicellular structures and tissues, and interact with their environments is a cornerstone of modern cell and developmental biology. Our ability to perform such experiments has been transformed by advances in molecular genetics, biological and chemical engineering of new fluorescent probes, and perhaps most dramatically by advances in our ability to image samples, dynamically over long time frames with high spatial and temporal resolution. This is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by the development of light sheet microscopy for long-term imaging of cells, tissues, and model organisms. This instrument has been top of the Bioimaging Facility ""wish list"" for several years. The opportunities provided by the system for imaging of larger specimens, with reduced phototoxicity, over long time frames led to it being named as Nature Methods_验 ""Method of the Year 2014"". The key advantage of the lateral illumination path compared to other modes with vertical illumination is reduced photodamage. This enables imaging over tens of hours to track cell movements in development and during pathological processes such as cancer, inflammation, and wound healing. In future it would also enable imaging of cleared brain samples for advanced neuroscience applications. ",378842,06/07/2017,University of Bristol,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
South West Regional Facility for High-Resolution Electron Cryo-Microscopy ,"Electron cryo-microscopy has recently been revolutionized by new direct electron detectors (DED) and image processing strategies. With these advances it is now possible to solve structures at near-atomic resolution. At present, high-resolution cryo-EM is not possible in the South-West due to the lack of a suitable cryo-microscope with field-emission gun, superior optics and DED. This restricts the PIs, including Wellcome Trust (WT) investigators, who must outsource this work. Their research would benefit immensely from the local availability of this new technology. Therefore, the acquisition would add significant value to current and future WT projects in this region. The plan is to form a new cryo-EM Facility with a state-of-the-art, multi-user cryo-microscope for single-particle EM and cryo-tomography. It will form a SW node to feed into the forthcoming WT-funded National Facility for high-resolution cryo-EM at Harwell. The regional facility will enable local data collection and allow the selection of only the very best samples for the high-end cryo-EM National installation at Harwell, to help maximise the output of the new National facility.A high-profile SW resource, together with the national facility, will entice researchers from diverse life-science areas to partake in the cryo-EM revolution and generate new and exciting research synergies.",1000000,16/06/2016,University of Bristol,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
A serum biomarker as a diagnostic for Human and Animal African Trypanosomiasis,"This Pathfinder award led by Dr Liam Morrison and Dr Finn Grey at the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, aims to develop a serum biomarker as a diagnostic for human and animal trypanosomiasis. Trypanosomiasis is one of the most significant infectious disease threats in sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomiasis is caused by the trypanosome parasite, which infects approximately 20 milllion cattle causing 3 million deaths per year. At least 55 million cattle are at risk with an annual cost of $2.5 billion in East Africa alone; 35 million doses of trypanocides are estimated to be used each year across Africa. Human Trypanosomiasis is also an ongoing issue with eradication by 2030 a major target for the World Health Organisation. Diagnosis of trypanosome infection is currently largely based on symptoms presented or relies on insensitive microscopy and large quantities of prophylactic drugs are used as a continuous measure to prevent disease. A few diagnosis options exist, but these rely on either antibodies to trypanosome antigens or amplification of DNA - both have limitations; the antibody test cannot differentiate between active infection and exposure, and the DNA target often persists after successful treatment. Additionally, for second stage disease in humans, when the parasite has crossed into the brain, current diagnosis relies upon a threshold of white blood cell numbers in the spinal fluid obtained through lumbar puncture, a feature that is not specific to trypanosomiasis.We have identified a biomarker in the blood of cattle infected with trypanosomes that can be used for the development of an accurate, sensitive and reliable diagnostic test. This project aims to further characterise this biomarker and, in collaboration with a partner company, develop cheap diagnostic tools that will allow rapid testing of cattle in a field environment, without the need for specialised equipment or training.

Designed for both previously engaged and new online audiences, the aim will be to deepen and broaden our engagement, respectively. This will include dance videos, explanations of the science/process behind them with researchers, ""DIY"" packs with the steps and opportunities to feedback ideas/questions. There'll be a particular focus on empowering teachers through lesson plans, curriculum-integrations, follow-up activities and the eventual development of training sessions to promote confidence in using an active, cross-curricular approach more widely in their teaching.Secondly, we_验ll go out to the communities to engage with school, community groups and public audiences through workshops, talks and events. Along with six self-funded tours across Scotland using the resources and content, this project will specifically fund three tours of more remote regions (Orkney, Shetland and Outer Hebrides) trialing a more community-led, multi-audience intensive approach to engage with rural communities with biomedical sciences.

Enabling flexible online and portable experiments in behavioural health sciences,"This project will bring a proven, flexible, popular software package into a new era of open, global, large-scale data collection. Many studies in behavioural sciences (psychology, neuroscience, linguistics and mental health) use computers to present stimuli and record responses in a precise manner. These studies are still typically conducted on small numbers of people in laboratory environments with dedicated hardware.With improved web technologies, high-speed broadband, and smart devices everywhere, studies can now run on the web without sacrificing high temporal precision. This is a ""game changer"" in terms of the research that can be conducted. Data can be collected on larger, more varied, international populations. We can study people in environments they don_验t find intimidating, and multiple times per day, without data collection becoming impractical.We need better tools to create those studies. PsychoPy is a cross-platform open-source software package for creating experiments using OpenGL and Python. It is hugely popular mostly because relatively non-technical users can generate an enormous range of studies with high precision. This project will make it possible for those same studies to be conducted online, and on Android/iOS, by providing JavaScript/HTML/WebGL outputs and a secure server from which users can run their studies.",207066,06/07/2017,University of Nottingham,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship,"Why is life in the first person? There is nothing more fundamental to the human condition than the question of consciousness, at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our existence. Without consciousness there is simply nothing at all: no world, no self, nothing. People have wondered about consciousness since they_验ve wondered about anything, but the relationship between conscious experience and biological wetware has remained perplexing, to scientists and clinicians, to philosophers and artists, indeed to everyone who has ever wondered at being at the centre of one_验s own _焉inner universe_验. At the same time, society is witnessing a vast increase in psychiatric and neurological illnesses _研 the edges of consciousness _研 which are poorly understood and inadequately treated.My vision is to combine pioneering research and public engagement (PE) to transform our understanding of the biological basis of consciousness in health and in illness, and in doing so, to reframe the way we _研 all of us _研  encounter being human. Following Copernicus and Darwin, deciphering the biological basis of consciousness will help us see ourselves as part of, and not apart from, the rest of nature. The scientific, medical, and cultural ramifications of these developments are dramatic, even extending beyond the human condition to change the way we see non-human animals and future intelligent machinery.  The science is already happening, with my research group among the pioneers. I will ensure the wider public not only comes along for the ride, but also becomes actively involved in shaping the research we do and the conclusions we draw. We are all conscious, so this matters to everyone.  I see a unique opportunity in combining my distinctively broad range of influential research with my already impactful PE activities. Presently, with few exceptions, most high-level PE comes from individuals dedicated to science communication, while most high-level scientists necessarily focus on research with PE activities treated as secondary. My vision is for a distinctive brand of high-quality PE made possible by my being simultaneously active at the highest levels of the relevant research. I am uniquely qualified to achieve and sustain this vision. I have published influential papers across a very broad range of topics in consciousness science (>100 papers published, h-index 40, see attached CV), and as editor of the academic journal Neuroscience of Consciousness I enjoy a broad field overview. In addition, I have already demonstrated a strong PE track record across many domains (see supplementary information, SI). These contributions provide the ideal platform from which I can realize my vision of research-led PE to transform our scientific and public understanding of the biology of consciousness.My vision encompasses informing and exciting the public about consciousness science through a variety of formats, engaging with clinical practitioners across psychiatry and neurology to develop a greater mutual appreciation for how consciousness science can inform diagnosis and treatment, and ensuring that consciousness science as a discipline becomes increasingly established as a central field within the mind and brain sciences.",167726,20/07/2016,University of Sussex,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Material Anxieties: The Perceived Health of Materials in Medical Products ,"This project will study the dynamic trajectories of materials like stainless steel, silicone rubber and PVC that make up clinical and direct-to-consumer healthcare products. I will follow materials as they move from manufacturing to the marketplace and beyond, exploring their perceived risks and rewards, and examining how the choices of materials scientists and designers influence users_验 experiences of health and wellbeing.The project_验s innovative tripartite method will afford a uniquely holistic understanding of human experiences of materials, combining ethnography, design research and psychophysics to allow for a simultaneous focus on the physical, sensory, aesthetic and cultural affordances of materials.My key goals are to firmly establish this new interdisciplinary approach, thereby providing a bridge between the laboratory, design studio, care environment and society, with the potential to influence design practice, research directions in materials science and practices and experiences of healthcare. In bringing together materials producers, designers, clinicians and users this project encourages dialogue and enables translation between isolated disciplinary and professional communities. It therefore takes crucial first steps towards the identification and development of materials that accord with clinical and societal needs.",200556,11/01/2016,University College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research

Postgraduate Bioethics Conference 2013.,"This small grant would help to support expenses for keynote speakers, masterclass leaders and student presenters at the Postgraduate Bioethics Conference (PGBC) 2013. PGBC is an annual conference for doctoral researchers in bioethics, which over the past six years has become the leading environment for UK doctoral candidates in bioethics to meet, network and present their work. The 2013 theme is Bioethics in Law and Public Policy. The Wellcome Trust has generously contributed toward the fundi ng of four previous PGBCs. This year's conference is significantly different in focus, and has considerable value added, from previous iterations. The two chief innovations are an overtly interdisciplinary focus, and emphasis on law and policy impact. For the first time, the conference will feature interdisciplinary masterclasses led jointly by a lawyer and an ethicist, which will encourage participants to reflect upon the relations between bioethics, law and public policy, and the ways in wh ich their doctoral research could translate into law and public policy. PGBC 2013 will also feature a workshop led by two assistant editors of the Journal of Medical Ethics, which will train students in how to survive peer review, both as an author, and a reviewer.",3175,28/05/2013,King's College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Evergreen: Patrick Geddes and the Environment in Equilibrium,"The aim of the project is to preserve, conserve, catalogue and virtually reunite two collections of papers of Sir Patrick Geddes at the universities of Edinburgh and Strathclyde.Sir Patrick Geddes (1854-1932) was a pioneer of the environmental movement and one of the greatest social thinkers of his time. His fascination with the organization of human societies and their spatial manifestation in the city and country led him to develop a highly individualistic theory of societies and cities. The collections, which are actually two halves of a single collection which was separated by historical accident, are of international significance and vividly document the development of all Geddes_验s theories.The objectives are to:1. enhance the existing, inadequate catalogues.2. reunite the collections virtually via an online shared resource.3. ensure the long-term preservation of both collections.4. make the collections _焉digitisation ready_验.5. engage researchers with the collections.The outcomes will be:1. a complete catalogue of each collection.2. a shared online resource virtually reuniting the collections.3. all collections repackaged in archival packaging.4. all significantly damaged items conserved.5. a small selection of items digitised.6. an active network of researchers with an interest in Geddes.    ",163894,25/11/2015,University of Edinburgh,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Finding Disease and Poor Health in Glasgow in the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries,"The main objective is to catalogue the records of Glasgow's Medical Officers of Health (MOH), Sanitary Officers and other related health records, 19th to 20th century; providing a multi-level description catalogue of the collection in accordance with international standards. In 2012 we were in receipt of a Wellcome funding scoping project for our health archives. The survey states that the MOH and related health collections should be made available for researchers as soon as possible, as they provide a unique insight into the control of health in Glasgow at a critical century of its history. It further identifies the archives as a key collection for the 'scholarly community' as it provided a 'remarkably full and rich resource' relating to the current theme of 'combatting infectious diseases', in addition to the two remaining forthcoming themes 'Investigating development, ageing and chronic disease' and 'Connecting nutrition, environment and health'. The provision of an accurate and detailed description of the collection will support the study of Glasgow, showing how disease and ill-health became entrenched in the City in the first half of the 19th century, and how successive world-renowned Medical Officers of Health fought to reverse the tide from the 1860s. As part of the project, the collection will be cleaned and repackaged, ensuring the collection is preserved for future users.",106151,20/11/2013,Glasgow Life,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Charity

Implicit Processes .,"Implicit Processes, a 10-minute long 16mm experimental art film, sets out to explore the implicit empathic processes of imitation in the general population (mirror systems; Gallese, 1995) that are made explicit for the mirror-touch synaesthete (Banissy, Ward et al, 1997). The film will build on my Wellcome Trust funded Sensorium Tests (2012), a Leverhulme International Network Award (2012-2013), and an AHRC Fellowship (2014-2015) to dramatise, in narrative form, the empathetic perceptual and soc ial experiences of mirror-touch synaesthetes.  Mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS) is a recently discovered neurological condition experienced by one in seventy-five people, in which visually observed touch to others bodies is perceived as a touch to the synaesthetes own body (Blakemore, Ward, et al, 2005).  The content and form of Implicit Processes will be based on my ethnographic project comprising twelve interviews with mirror-touch synaesthetes about their experiences- the first qualitative doc ument of the condition.  Implicit Processes will bring into vivid focus for general audiences staged manifestations of these experiences generated in theatre workshops, and conducted within a specially designed set, which itself physicalises accounts of mirror-touch synaesthesia. Implicit Processes will explore the relationship between two characters with mirror-touch synaesthesia who earlier appeared in my Wellcome Trust funded screenplay, Empathy. Grounded in a multi-disciplinary, research-led , process-driven approach, I will draw on film aesthetics, anthropology, performance, neuroscience, and my rich background in artmaking to bring into artistic life the lived experiences of mirror-touch synaesthetes and to draw out ethical questions about empathy within the larger culture.",29900,05/02/2014,University of Oxford,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Replay: Fictions from the Five Stages of Sleep.,"This project will introduce general readers to key concepts and recent breakthroughs in the science of sleep, through the commission of ten short stories by authors working in one-to-one collaborations with sleep researchers. The stories (accompanied by afterwords written by each consulting researcher) will be first published in an anthology, and then fed into a specially developed smartphone 'app' which will enable users to explore a 3-D map of the brain while listening to the stories and after words. The app will also feature short animations of different sleeping-brain activities, embedded into the 3-D map, as well as glossaries and anatomical information.    The science of sleep is at a very exciting stage in its history. Recent studies are revolutionizing the way we think about sleep and its relationship to memory, decision making, and motor skills. However very little of this new research has so far filtered through into the general consciousness. Fiction writers - despite story telling's age-old fascination with sleep and dreams - generally only engage with the psychology of sleep, but rarely with the neuroscience of it. This commission will allow writers to explore a range of neuroscience topics: from sleep disorders like parasomnia to sleeping-brain activities like network consolidation and memory 'replays' (hence the title). The double-sidedness of sleep - as both an intimate experience and a physical, neurological activity will be mirrored by the two-tiered approac h of the book and app: literary/imaginative in the former format; visual, three-dimensional and physical in the latter.",16700,02/10/2013,Comma Press,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Company

'Are we all addicts now?' .,"'Are we all addicts now?' is an artist-led enquiry into how the conditions of the digital are simultaneously shaped by us and also shaping us. McLuhan's maxim is that every new technology creates a new human environment. Emergent pathologies such as internet addiction and digital dementia are symptomatic of this new human environment. 'Are we all addicts now?' is led by artist Katriona Beales, in partnership with curator Fiona MacDonald, and in collaboration with Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, Vanes sa Bartlett and Dr Mark Wright. The project builds on Katriona Beales' video installation, 'White Matter' (2015), a response to internet addiction commissioned by FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) and supported by Arts Council England.

Enhanced integration of primary and secondary health systems and patient empowerment through improved continuity of patient care and clinical handover.,"Effective integration of care between community (primary) and hospital care (secondary) health services is essential for a patient whose needs extend beyond the initial episode, and more care is required by the next level of health provider. This may include referral to a hospital if a primary care doctor cannot manage the condition or the continuation of medication and check-ups in the primary care after a hospital admission. The crucial stage is communication of patient-specific information from one caregiver to another or to the patient and family, for the purpose of ensuing patient care continuity and safety, termed clinical handover. A review of evidence in the high-income countries showed that the consequences of ineffective handover led to incorrect treatment, delays in medical diagnosis, life-threatening adverse events, patient complaints, increased health care expenditure, increased length of stay, increased re-admissions, and other impacts on health systems. Although we have not been able to find similar data for LMIC, experience and discussions with partners and experts indicate that the rate of adverse events and other unwanted outcomes due to poor handover are even greater in LMICs due to huge gaps in integration of health providers. It is likely therefore, that considerable scope exists to improve practice in a way that is cost-effective and potentially even cost releasing. These may be adapted from methods that have been successfully implemented in high-income countries (e.g. check-lists, patient held records). There is a global focus from the WHO on health systems development, critical for a better response to challenges of emergencies, infectious and other diseases. The rise in elderly populations and deteriorating lifestyle behaviours (e.g. smoking rates) in LMICs have increased the burden of heart related, diabetes and other long term diseases. Due to their need for on-going care, these are particularly adversely affected by poor integration between primary and secondary care. Thus the main drivers for our proposal are evidence for the following: -clinical handover processes are at the core of patient safety and consequences of inadequate clinical handover result in poor patient outcome and high cost to the health system - Clinical handover is a global priority identified by the WHO Patient Safety Programme. There is need and interest in many LMICs to improve integration between-levels of health care, but little evidence to guide local decision makers in how to identify and overcome barriers to improved practice -initial interventions can be culturally and politically acceptable, affordable and sustainable, but that such interventions have not been systematically explored, tested or implemented The objectives of this one year project (part of a extensive five-year programme) are: 1) describe existing situation in terms of policies, training, activities, and culture for clinical handover between primary and secondary care during referrals and discharge 2)identify barriers and facilitators (health care system and patient related) for improving clinical handover 3)develop options for intervention 4)build health systems research capacity. These will be achieved through a range of complex research methods that would involve all stakeholders from policy makers to patients. The immediate benefits of this phase will be for the hospital and community health care practitioners and policy makers who will be able to use the findings to start addressing some of the affordable solutions identified, researchers who will learn health system assessment techniques novel to them, and ultimately the patients who will receive a better seamless health care through the development and implementation of interventions. The follow-on intervention study is hoped to roll out into long-term programmes that could dramatically improve integration of primary and hospital care services.",33836,25/03/2014,University of Birmingham,The Wellcome Trust,,N,elderly,Research
Heard Voices: Musical Hauntings.,"Heard Voices: Musical Hauntings is a musical work populated by voices and songs humorous and poignant, whimsical and disturbing.  As a performance piece, it is atmospheric, engaging and thought-provoking.  And as a piece of science in action, it reveals some of the processes by which we hear, remember and recall music.  Heard Voices: Musical Hauntings develops two established strands of research (both supported by the Wellcome Trust): Hearing the Voice (led by Charles Fernyhough), which has  been exploring the ways in which inner speech is externalised in the form of hallucinatory voices; and Tales from Babel (led by Edward Wickham and Christopher Fox) which engages with the science of hearing text in music and words sung or spoken against background noise.  In this new project, we intend to express the experience of auditory musical hallucinations in the form of an hour-long musical work which develops from a series of musical 'hauntings' - fragments of songs, half-remembered and i mperfectly recalled, presented in ways which reflect the operation of our musical and auditory memory and the intrusions from memory that happen in voice-hearing. The work will draw on and reflect the experiences both of the voice-hearing community, gathered via channels already established by Hearing the Voice, and of those who report musical hallucinations.  These experiences will feed into the performed work. and thereby engage a different type of audience with classical vocal and contempo rary, experimental music.",24667,05/02/2014,The Clerks,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Community
Genetics and Biocolonialism in Contemporary Literature and Film.,"This project will explore the representation in global literature and film of genetic research on vulnerable and isolated populations. This research has gained significant media attention - from the Human Genome Diversity Project to the HeLa controversy - and has led to medical science and the pharmaceutical industry being framed as agents of 'biocolonialism', a term highlighting the power dynamics involved when minority groups are 'mined' for their genetic riches. The research programme will us e postcolonial critical methodologies to investigate how creative depictions of genetics can help us understand the cultural politics of biomedical research, focusing especially on work by indigenous, postcolonial, and minority writers. It starts from the premise that the creative arts, and modes of critique drawn from literary and cultural studies, can be transformative in facilitating cross-cultural understanding, dialogue, and knowledge exchange regarding genetic science. Concepts like intell ectual property are often incompatible with non-western worldviews, and produce conflicts over how human life is valued in the genomic era. The researchers will explore how imaginative texts portray such tensions, and evaluate their implications for debates taking place within bioethics, health policy, and international law. Key goals of the programme extend from producing high-quality academic outputs to using creative works to engage the public with cross-cultural experiences of genetic resear ch. Its overarching aims are to advance the globalisation of the medical humanities by promoting postcolonial approaches to biomedicine, and to aid the Wellcome Trust in developing ethical frameworks that empower global communities in their engagements with genetic research.",109220,23/07/2015,University of Leeds,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Supporting excellence in basic and clinical research: A flow cytometry/sorting and cell imaging platform for the genotypic and phenotypic analysis of Hazard Group 3 pathogens.,"Funding is requested for a BD-FACS-Aria-Fusion cell-sorter and a Zeiss-LSM-710-confocal microscope to be housed in LSTM's Hazard-Group-3 (HG3)-containment laboratories.  This equipment is principally to support Trust-funded investigators/fellows requiring HG3-biosafety to comply with HSE requirements.  The Schools focus on pathogens (many HG3) that cause disease rather than non-pathogenic surrogates has imposed stringent biological safety requirements. The ability to carry out technically ch allenging image-based science for our internal programmes and clinical samples derived from Wellcome Trust Overseas Programmes (e.g.Malawi/Kenya/Vietnam) while ensuring the highest levels of operator safety requires investment. The complementary imaging platform of flow-cytomety (with sorting) and confocal microscopy (real-time live imaging of cells/tissues) will allow PIs the ability of genotyping and phenotyping live HG3-pathogens.  This is an essential requirement in order to facilitate s tudies into the temporal responses of important pathogens to experimental perturbations and the isolation of organisms/cells with specific genotypic/phenotypic traits for further investigation.  The described HG3-imaging facility, set in one of CTIDs 22 HG3-containment laboratories, will be the first dedicated facility in the North West and possibly the UK, supporting LSTM's and UK's position as an international leader in tropical disease research.",598054,25/06/2014,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
New Light on Old Art: The Science of Seeing in Colour.,"Support is requested for an interactive mixed-media exhibit which will form a key part of a ground-breaking exhibition on 'Colour', to be shown at the National Gallery from June to September 2014. This will bring together the National Gallery's pioneering scientific research and outstanding works of art with new research on human visual perception, to explore the material history of colour and enhance public understanding both of visual art and the science of colour perception. The exhibition wi ll take the public through a 700-year history of colouring materials and techniques used by Western artists and culminate in the proposed interactive exhibit, featuring spectrally tuneable LED-based lighting technology and artworks installed in a dedicated space. Digital presentations, interactive demonstrations and a mass experiment will elucidate fundamental phenomena of human colour vision, and how these underpin the appreciation and interpretation of visual art. New scientific findings on th e limits of human perceptual constancies under artificial and natural illuminations will be presented, and further advanced by the results of the mass experiment. The digital media content will also be shown on the National Gallery's website as a long-term legacy of the project, and the exhibition will be accompanied by a wide-ranging education programme. The digital media and interactive demonstrations and perceptual experiments will be produced as a collaboration between the National Gallery,  scientists at Newcastle University and the University of East Anglia, and lighting engineers from the Catalonia Institute for Energy Research (IREC), Barcelona.",30000,10/10/2013,National Gallery,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Charity

REMI-seq: generation of a genome wide mutant resource for Dictyostelium functional genomics.,"Dictyostelium offers a powerful model system for discovery genetics and biomedical research, with strength in areas including chemotaxis, cell signalling and developmental biology. Existing bio-resources include the complete genome sequence and transcriptional profiles. However, full exploitation of this data is hampered by lack of a systematic, genome-wide collection of Dictyostelium mutants. To remove this key bottleneck, we will employ a novel technique (REMI-seq) to rapidly create a geno me-wide collection of barcoded insertional mutants using next generation sequencing (NGS). Each mutant will be mapped to the Dictyostelium genomic sequence and be searchable via dictyBase, a pre-existing publically accessible genome resource. Individual mutants, collections and random mutant pools will be available to the research community via dictyBase through the Dicty Stock Center. Specific objectives: (1) combine Restriction Enzyme Mediated Integration (REMI) insertional mutagenesis wit h NGS technology to create a genome-wide set of single gene mutants with defined insertion sites; (2) create a resource of individual, sets and pools of mutants, and develop new genomic level screening strategies for population fitness and parallel phenotyping to probe sub-lethal sensitivity changes to developmental signals, toxins or drugs; (3) integrate the REMI-seq data to dictyBase to provide direct access to the resource.",498592,08/05/2013,University of Manchester,The Wellcome Trust,,N,sports and fitness,Research

Institutional Strategic Support Fund 2012/13,"a) Seedcorn Our rationale will be to direct resources where, based on individual cases, we can see the most impact. We will be flexible in what can be requested; we will consider funding for personnel with support for consumables or multiuser small equipment. Our priorities will be new investigators, projects with a clear demonstration that the funding will lead to grant application, projects where critical data is required to translate an important discovery or where we can see significant leverage by securing external funding for strategic priority areas. b) Enhancing and developing core multi-user facilities We have identified two such key core facilities in this period, bioinformatics and biophysics. Bioinformatics builds upon our success from the last round (vide supra) and biophysics will be a core facility for entire BSRC. Bioinformatics (http://bioinformatics.st-andrews.ac.uk/ [http://bioinformatics.st-andrews.ac.uk/]) is a joint Biology and Medicine initiative. The biophysics facility coupled to investment in protein production facilities and crystallization ensure we remain competitive. ci) People: bridging We have an excellent track record of bridging researchers into their own independent careers or between positions This flexible pot of money allows us to fund people not projectscii) People: Key technologistsFor the biophysics centre we will fund a person for two years to set up and establish the facility and continue support for Dr Miguel Pinheiro. Other key core technologists are currently self-sustaining we have reserved some funding in case we need to invest over the two year period. d) Public engagement We will use ISSF funds to create a coordinated effort for public engagement across life sciences. We will recruit a person and provide dedicated administrative support.",500000,17/10/2012,University of St Andrews,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Curing Perfect.,"What is a learning disability? A medical condition or is it who you are? Curing Perfect is a piece of art that will engage audiences in these questions as it draws them into an online graphic novel and a world where people have been made 'perfect' by science. It will challenge them to think about what a world of perfection would be like, what sacrifices would be made in striving for such a world and what role gene and stem cell therapy would have in achieving this. Curing Perfect will be a  creative response to the implications and ethics of these scientific developments led by experienced learning disabled artists and film makers. They will challenge the audience to move through this 'perfect' world and interact with what they find. Using Transmedia techniques the artists will exploit online technology, using drawing, animation and 'live' footage to create a visually engaging world. Social media, emails and text messages as well as more traditional promotion will invite audiences  to engage, whilst parts of the story will break out into the real world through live debate and discussion.  Carousel - a learning disability led arts organisation and the University of Birmingham Biomedical Ethics department represented by Dr June Jones (senior lecturer) will work in partnership to deliver Curing Perfect.  The development of the work will be supported by Carousel staff, Circa69 (audio-visual artist Simon Wilkinson) and Creative Technologist Alex Peckham.",29785,20/01/2015,Carousel,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Charity
Flesh on the bones,"Norton Priory is the most excavated monastic site in Europe. As well as the excavated ruins there is a grade I listed 12th century undercroft, a giant 14th century statue of St Christopher and an 18th century Walled Garden. However, deteriorating environmental conditions in the museum has led to the removal of much of this nationally significant collection from display. In July 2014 the Museum was awarded a 耄3.7m grant from the HLF to redevelop the museum and restore the undercroft. As part of the new exhibition, the museum will display human remains, drawing upon its stored collection representing some 130 individuals. Recent and ongoing research has resulted in some surprising findings including the discovery by osteoarchaeologist, Shirley Curtis-Summers of a trauma indicating the likely murder of a 13th century knight. This story and others like it will be enlivened by the biographical research by early career PhD research graduates to help create multidisciplinary displays. Diseases will be explored through the use of the skeletal material in both displays and education sessions. Uniquely, the surprisingly high incidence and severity of Paget's disease will be sensitively explored with the assistance and life-experience of present day sufferers. When this project is completed, the new exhibition will inspire visitors with the kind of excitement that scientific discovery can stimulate. It will be an interactive experience that will capture the imagination of a range of audiences drawing upon a programme of ongoing research.

Madge Gill: Medium and Visionary.,"This major exhibition of outsider and visionary artist Madge Gill (1882-1961) is planned as a collaborative project across the arts and sciences. This interdisciplinary project will bring together mental health service users from the Art & Soul group, curators, art critics, art psychotherapists and psychologists to share their reflections and interpretations of Gill's life and work through a film and publication. At the age of thirty-seven, after suffering an illness that left her blind in h er left eye, Gill began to create art passionately and created thousands of mediumistic work over 40 years. She claimed to be guided by a spirit called 'Myrninrest' and often signed her drawings with this name. Her drawings often contain the figure of a young woman, possibly a self portrait. Her work is in all sizes from postcard size to over 30ft. The exhibition will contain loans from Newham Borough Council (who hold rarely seen work by Gill in their collection) and from the Henry Boxer Galler y and will be curated by Roger Cardinal, a leading critic who originally coined the term 'outsider art.' By holding the exhibition in a well-known public art gallery, the project will aim to reach new audiences not normally engaged in history of medicine, whilst at the same time celebrating the benefits of creativity for mental and emotional well-being for those in the present day.",20450,10/04/2013,Orleans House Gallery,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Making genomic medicine.,"Genomic medicine emerged around the turn of the twenty-first century as a site of particularly intense activity in biomedical research and policy-making, prompted in large part by the expectation that developments in genomic science and technology would effect an epochal transformation in health care.  My goal is to locate these developments in historical perspective, by producing a comprehensive account of the socio-technical process that resulted in the current ferment of activity around genom ic medicine.  Research to date indicates that the story is an exceptionally interesting and important one, dating back at least to the 1970s, and involving not just dramatic developments in medical science and technology, but also shifts in the orientation of public health policy, changes in the organisation and funding of clinical science and medicine, the emergence of new pharmaceutical business models, changes in the regulatory environment for biomedicine, and the growing influence of pat ient groups.  My research into these processes will pursue three inter-connected strands of historical analysis: 1: Making genomic risk 2: Genomicising drug discovery and development 3: The rise of rare diseases My findings will be of more than just academic interest.  By analysing the scientific and social factors that led to the emergence of genomic medicine, I aim to help to frame and inform current debates about the future of biomedicine.",821639,28/01/2013,University of Edinburgh,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
The Edinburgh Protein Production Facility (EPPF).,"The Edinburgh Protein Production Facility (EPPF) has made a major contribution to the direction of research across biological sciences and molecular medicine at the University of Edinburgh. EPPF has stimulated studies that rely on pure, biophysically characterised proteins, both within the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology (WTCCB) and the broader Edinburgh biomedical research community. Escalating demand has been matched by continuous improvements in productivity. To sustain and expand the  protein-based studies that underpin a growing number of biomedical research projects, new equipment and continuity of key staff are essential. There is also now a pressing need to provide the support required for detailed molecular analysis of multi-component biological systems.  Research into spliceosomes, ribosomes, kinetochores and chromatin-remodelling complexes, amongst others, is driving demand in Edinburgh for pure, well-characterised macromolecular complexes and their components. A fo cus of this proposal is to develop the requisite capabilities and expertise within EPPF.  This entails enhanced eukaryotic protein production capabilities alongside the implementation of size-exclusion chromatography with multiple-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) for sample analysis.

"Naked Neuroscience: a spine-tingling interactive, educational multimedia initiative","Working alongside research-active neuroscientists and educators, we envisage the creation of a multimedia, neuroscience-focused, audience-interactive touring stage show aimed at schools and the general public and comprising a series of linked experiments and demonstrations designed to illustrate the workings of the nervous system. This initiative, which will be curriculum-relevant and targeted at ages 12 and up, will be supported by a suite of freely-accessible online multimedia content including illustrated webpages, worksheets and interactive experiments for users to try at home, as well as video sequences and a monthly 60 minute neuroscience podcast. The podcast will be conversational, news-led and feature updates on recent discoveries in the neuroscience arena as well as interviews with leading researchers internationally. Moreover, it will be produced and presented by researchers themselves, providing valuable training in traditional and new media broadcast techniques. To maximise the overall reach of the project, the resulting content will also form part of the weekly output of the Naked Scientists BBC radio show, podcast and website. These are existing awardwinning public engagement initiatives that reach a large (multi-million scale) and diverse listenership from a range of ages and backgrounds, including audiences judged to be hard to reach. Together, these initiatives will enable us to take neuroscience-focused content to millions of people, including, most critically, young people whose interest in science we are seeking to nurture. At the same time, the direct involvement of scientists of all levels, including PhD students and undergraduates, means that we have an opportunity to help these researchers to develop their own skills in public engagement while simultaneously ensuring that the resulting project content remains scientifically robust and relevant.",120576,05/05/2011,University of Cambridge,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
"The Scottish Women's Hospital Archives, 1911-1922: Delivering medical care on the Western front","The main objective is to catalogue the Scottish Women's Hospital (SWH) archivecollection, providing a multi-level description catalogue of the collection inaccordance with International standards. In 2012 we were in receipt of a Wellcome funded scoping project of our Public Archives and those of the SWH. The survey identified SWH as a key collection of interest to the 'scholarly community', as it includes material relating to the current theme of 'combatting infectious diseases', in addition to the 2 remaining forthcoming themes 'Investigating development, ageing and chronic disease' and 'Connectingnutrition, environment and health'. We also recognised that the timetable for this is crucial, with the imminent 100th anniversary of the start of the FirstWorld War. The provision of an accurate and detailed description of the collection will support the study of an organisation which made such a crucialcontribution to the delivery of medical care during the war. It will also provide a focus of interest in what was arguably a key factor in the changing role of women in medicine in the UK. As part of the project, the collectionwill be cleaned, repackaged and relocated, ensuring the collection is preserved for future users.",69674,15/05/2013,Glasgow Life,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Charity

Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship 2012.,"The Wellcome Trust is widely recognised in the UK and internationally as the leading funder of innovative public engagement, inviting the public to explore big scientific challenges. Likewise, I have a reputation and passion for delivering innovative, high-quality public engagement across the interface of science, medicine and the humanities.Public engagement has an important role in achieving extraordinary improvements in human health and, as a pioneer who works with the public, including with some of the most deprived, yet creative communities in the UK, I can offer a considerable contribution to the Wellcome Trust Vision. Through my public engagement endeavours, I work responsively to cultural contexts and strive to forge trust in order to breakdown the barriers between researchers and the public. By way of example, my public engagement endeavours have connected non-English speaking communities at risk of disease and infection to work alongside researchers investigating associated biomedical diseases. These public engagement activities have transformed community members into advocates and translators of important health information.My experience and commitment to creativity, intellectual curiosity, professional development and organisational learning ensure I thrive as a Wellcome Trust Fellow. As a filmmaker and archive fanatic I was inspired by the Wellcome Library collection, with a game, Lost Cats Legacy, that caught the attention of Sheffield International Documentary Festival. I am excited by the public engagement possibilities of the digitised material from the Wellcome Library_验s collection and the prospect of support from Wellcome staff to unlock its creative potential.A Wellcome Fellowship would present considerable strategic added value by helping me to consolidate lessons from _焉networked_验 and citizen-led approach to public engagement that I am pursuing.

Determinants of effectiveness of a novel community health workers programme inimproving maternal and child health in Nigeria.,"The AIM of this project is to inform strengthening and scaling up of community health worker (CHW) programmes. This will be done by investigating two implementations (with and without conditional cash transfers) of a Nigerian CHW programme, to understand what factors, under what conditions, promote equitable access to quality services, and improve maternal and child health outcomes. We will: 1. Understand of the context and the process of implementation of the interventions; 2. Identify, assess and compare the intervention outputs and outcomes; 3. Develop a model of complex relations between the actors, context, implementation process, outputs and outcomes of the interventions; 4. Develop transferable best practices for scalability and generalizability of the interventions. This five-year study will be implemented in two States in Nigeria - Niger State in the North and Anambra State in the South, identified in consultation with the Federal MOH and SUREP national programme officer. The project is designed as a multidisciplinary and mixed methods study, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Realist evaluation will be an overall platform for the study, which will use economic evaluation, social sciences and statistical analysis. Qualitative data will be collected using in-depth interviews with facility managers, community health workers, PHC staff; facility exit interviews and focus group discussions with service users and their families. Quantitative data will include existing data from HMIS and SURE-P programme and structured facility exit survey with pregnant women. Analysis of quantitative and qualitative datasets will be integrated, to allow in-depth exploration of emerging issues and continuous triangulation of findings.

The Health of People: maximising the contribution of the social sciences,"To optimise the health of the UK population within the context of increasing longevity and demand, without increased resources to match, we need to do things differently in preventing ill-health, optimising the benefits of biomedical advances and managing long-term conditions. Increased application of the social and behavioural sciences would be transformational.  Much illness and disability could be prevented by supporting people to change their behaviour, such as stopping smoking, reducing alcohol consumption, eating more healthily and being more active. The impact of biomedical advances could be increased manifold by increasing adherence by patients to, e.g., medication and by increasing health professional adherence to evidence-based practice.  Long-term conditions could be managed more effectively by all of these steps as well as harnessing new technologies and social systems, which depend of understandings from the social sciences.This project aims to (i) identify the key contributions of the social and behavioural sciences to optimising population health, (ii) engage potential users of that knowledge, including government, the NHS and Public Health England, research funders and other public, charity and private sector organisations in that process, and (iii) maximise the translation of knowledge about social science contribution to changing policy and practice to improve health.

The Noise.,"Building on our award winning track record for innovative collaborations with scientists, Unlimited Theatre will research, develop and produce a new show about sound and its impact on us - physically, emotionally, psychologically. In recent years we have worked closely with scientists (mostly in quantum and astro physics) to research and develop a series of new plays, events and experiences that have been enormously successful in bringing leading edge research in these fields to a large audie nce. For all of these projects, we have also worked closely with a composer David Edwards - better known by his recording name Minotaur Shock. Our work together has led to an increasingly important focus on how music and sound affect and influence our audiences' experience and conversations about what the physical processes of that experience are. This, in turn, has led us to start conversations with Dr Denis McKeown (Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Leeds) and Pr ofessor Tim Griffiths (Professor of Cognitive Neurology at Newcastle University and a Wellcome Senior Clinical Fellow) about the neurology of sound, specifically it's impact and influence on Memory  and how we remember/recall/forget/store information. For this project, we will work closely with our consultant scientists to make a new show with biomedical science at its heart.

This formation of recipes with fisherman, wildlife enthusiasts and berry pickers will act as a form of critical creativity, revealing the complex ecologies of the Thames Estuary. Through public foraging, cooking and eating workshops in Leigh-on-Sea (home of London's indigenous shellfish c ulture), we will create meaningful culinary experiments that explore processes of environmental change. Led by artist Fran Gallardo and environmental chemist and food scientist Mark Scrimshaw, this participatory investigation will culminate in a published 'recipe book', containing safe instructions for such delicacies as dressed transsexual crab, potted threatened shrimp, and landfill samphire, with an outline of their ecological and sociopolitical significance, and contextual material gathered  from situated and expert knowledge. Recipes will represent and re-imagine webs of connections between gastronomic, economic and material interdependency within many environments: human microbiomes, eels, fungi, geese, ships, landfills, and human-made islands. Via the recipe book (print and eBook), an online film, an eco-culinary residency in London, social media, and events, we will share these investigations with a broad audience. The recipe book will serve as an informative, inspirational  starting point for culinary-based public engagement activities around other complex environments.

THRIVE to Research Excellence (THRIVE-2),"THRiVE (hereafter called THRiVE-1) was established in 2009 with the underlying10-year vision of developing a regional network of research excellence, including some of the best universities and research institutes in East Africa(EA) with support from two leading UK universities (LSHTM and UC). Our currentvision is that by 2030 Africa will lead research that has a major impact on health in the region and make significant contributions to world health. In five years, we have built a robust network that has led to strong and productive multidisciplinary collaborations in training, research, supervisionand mentorship. We recruited the best applicants and linked them with leading research groups in EA, a strategy that has spawned more than 400 publications between THRiVE-1 partners since 2010. The excellent PhD and post-doctoral fellows we recruited are emerging as potential research leaders. We made significant efforts to improve institutional capacity in research management and public engagement. Building on this successful research training and mentorship platform, our strategy in THRiVE-2 is to significantly and rapidly enhance the transformation of East African universities into world class research hubs, byspearheading the transition of PhD and post-doctoral fellows into health research leaders. We aim to continue strengthening the THRiVE-1 network to harness synergies to groom and mentor the most promising young scientists trained in THRIVE-1 and others selected in THRIVE-2 to become independent, internationally-recognised research leaders doing excellent research that addresses EA's priority health problems. We will continue to support the uptake of research findings and innovations into policy and practice. We will focus our strengths that have emerged in the past 5 years in key areasof infectious diseases/neglected tropical diseases (IDs/NTDs), maternal, neonatal and reproductive health (MN/RH) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (Figure 1): all of which are major and priority and emerging health problems in the region. We have identified more than 300 potential supervisors and mentors across the Consortium, including world leaders, doing cutting-edge research in these themes. To ensure a continuing pipeline, we will continue to seek out, recruit and mentor the best young scientists in EA who have creative and bold ideas at undergraduate, Masters, PhD, and post-doctoral levels and provide them with training, supervision, mentorship and excellent research environments. We willensure that women scientists make up a significant proportion of those recruited through our established merit based recruitment process.

Developing Excellence in Leadership and Genetic Training for Malaria Elimination in Sub-Saharan Africa (DELGEME),"Despite recent important progress in decreasing malaria burden around the World, globally, an estimated 198 million cases of malaria occurred globally in 2013, leading to to 584 000 deaths. The burden is heaviest in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 90% of all malaria deaths occur, and in children aged under 5 years, who account for 78% of all deaths. [WHO 2014]. The high level of diversity of malaria parasites in the African continent contravenes elimination strategies and sustains the high burden of the disease in Africa. Knowledge of the genome wide diversity of the parasite, gene flow and adaptive processes are required to develop and refine elimination strategies. Indeed, the confirmation of Plasmodium falciparum artemisinin resistance in South-East Asia calls for pre-emptive surveillance of African parasite populations for genetic markers of emerging drug resistance. Because of unprecedented technological advances, there is a sharp increase in the production of genetic data from a range of pathogens including malaria parasites. Yet, very little of these thousands of terabites of sequence data has been translated into knowledge relevant for malaria control. This is mainly due to the fact that there is a ""strong wall"" between the malaria control community and the geneticists, indeed the two groups hardly understandeach other's languages. We propose to ""tear down this wall"". Indeed the translation of these genetic sequences into knowledge requires cutting edge skills that are currently lacking in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, genetics is increasingly required for decision making in major public health threats such as HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and other tropical diseases. To address this gap, a couple of years ago we established an African-led consortium, the African Plasmodium Diversity Network (PDNA) [Ghansah et al. Science]. PDNA includes Research and Academic Institutions from fifteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Through this DELTAS Africa proposal, which is driven by the PDNA leaders, will primarily focus on bridging the gap between public health community and geneticist through effectively engaging health workers and communities to interact with relevant genetic information. The main aims of this training programme will be to (1)Train, retain and develop graduates,doctoral and Postdoctoral fellows on genomics and bioinformatics across malaria endemic countries and (2) Develop programs to enhance the understanding and dissemination of genetic data relevant to malaria interventions and eradication programmes. Short-term training will be delivered for PDNA fellows including public health officers on genetics, clinical studies, ethics, grant writing, grant management and student supervision. Formal long-term curricula (big data science, biostatistics, health informatics, genomics, cell biology, molecular biology and bioinformatics) will be designed and implemented with contribution and oversight from a wide range of local and International Faculty and relevant advisory boards. Trainees already familiar with or actively involved in disease control will be targeted for recruitment. Customized career development and mentorship of targeted scientists will reveal and nurture new leaders in these specific fields.We will increasing the number of skilled Africans capable of leading the field and fulling exploiting genetics for the improvement of health in Africa.",905541,05/05/2015,Mali Service Centre,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Institutional Strategic Support Fund FY2013/14,"a) Seedcorn Our rationale will be to direct resources where, based on individual cases, we can see the most impact. We will be flexible in what can be requested; we will consider funding for personnel with support for consumables or multiuser small equipment. Our priorities will be new investigators, projects with a clear demonstration that the funding will lead to grant application, projects where critical data is required to translate an important discovery or where we can see significant leverage by securing external funding for strategic priority areas. b) Enhancing and developing core multi-user facilities We have identified two such key core facilities in this period, bioinformatics and biophysics. Bioinformatics builds upon our success from the last round (vide supra) and biophysics will be a core facility for entire BSRC. Bioinformatics (http://bioinformatics.st-andrews.ac.uk/ [http://bioinformatics.st-andrews.ac.uk/]) is a joint Biology and Medicine initiative. The biophysics facility coupled to investment in protein production facilities and crystallization ensure we remain competitive. ci) People: bridging We have an excellent track record of bridging researchers into their own independent careers or between positions This flexible pot of money allows us to fund people not projectscii) People: Key technologistsFor the biophysics centre we will fund a person for two years to set up and establish the facility and continue support for Dr Miguel Pinheiro. Other key core technologists are currently self-sustaining we have reserved some funding in case we need to invest over the two year period. d) Public engagement We will use ISSF funds to create a coordinated effort for public engagement across life sciences.

"Molecular and development alterations in circadian clock function in various strains of the Mexican blind cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus.","A major environmental cue for most organisms is the daily cycle of light and darkness Consequently, most organisms have developed a system, synchronised by the light/dark cycle coordinating physiology and behaviour with the environment. This system is known as the circadian clock and was proposed to be a neural phenomenon residing in a region of the central nervous system: the SCN. Over the last decade, research has led to a decentralisation of the circadian clock with discoveries of independent peripheral oscillators both in vivo (Whitmore et al, 1998) and in vitro cell culture (Whitmore et al, 2000; Welsh et al, 2004). Additionally, zebrafish cells can detect light and use this to set the phase of the circadian clock. Recent research in our lab has begun to investigate the workings of the circadian clock in a species of fish that lives in perpetual darkness, and is therefore missing the major environmental cue for most living organisms. This work has been performed using the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus; a single teleost species consisting of a sighted surface-dwelling form and several independent cave dwelling forms. Cavefish have lost eyes and pigmentation, as well as gaining constructive feature: such as increased jaw size and taste bud number. Selective pressures for retaining light adaptive features such as pigmentation are relaxed in the absence of light, and it is believed that pigmentation is lost through neutral mutations in the Oca2 gene (Protas et al, 2006). Little research has been performed on circadian clocks in cave animals, and particularly not on cave animals with living con-specific surface dwelling ancestors. This is important because when the ancestral surface form is still present, a direct comparison can be made between ancestral and derived developmental states. Astyanax is thus an important model for understanding the molecular basis of developmental changes in the context microevolution. Jeffery suggested ""cavefish can be compared with surface fish in essentially the same way as mutants are compared with wild-type phenotypes"" (Jeffery, 2008). We possess a model in which we can investigate a range of clock phenotypes. We will use surface fish and the two different populations of cavefish (Pachon and Steinhard) in our proposed research to further understand clock mechanisms in a dark adapted animal and assess whether cavefish really are clock mutants. If they are mutants in the clock me",148911,29/08/2008,University College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
Creating a Centre of Perception Research at the Science Museum,"Led by Neuroscientist Beau Lotto in collaboration with key staff of London's Science Museum, Lottolab Studio is creating the world's first Centre of Perception Research (CoPR - previously called 'The Box'). CoPR will be a public science lab housed in a large, open and prominent gallery in London's Science Museum. CoPR's ambition is to transform the public's view of science and themselves by enabling the public to become integral to the process of scientific research into human perception. The concept at the core of the centre is simply this: The best form of public engagement is science itself. What's needed is a topic that transcends disciplines and is relevant to everyone (perception), and an approach to engagement that enables the public to take ownership of science (a public lab environment). We have devised 7 programmes that put the public at the heart of the process of discovery. This proposal seeks to clarify and trial these public programmes at London's Science Museum, which will result in critical research and specific deliverables into a fundamentally different form of public engagement in public spaces.",13363,16/04/2012,Lottolab Studio,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Company
"How do local participatory governance reforms influence equitable access to health services? The role of Panchayati Raj Institutions in Kerala, India.","The Public Health Foundation of India, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the National HealthSystems Resource Centre (NHSRC) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India will come together to explore how local participatory governance (LPG) reforms influence equitable access to health services. LPG of social sectors (such as health or education) entails decentralised planning and oversight of services, undertaken through participatory and deliberative processes involving local communities and stakeholders. The salutary impact of LPG on health access is widely acknowledged, however the actual pathways of such change are not well researched, and the role of context in influencing these pathways also remains poorly understood.This research aims to address these gaps in the knowledge, using the case study of Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI)reforms in Kerala state, India. In India, LPG is synonymous with PRIs - locally elected bodies operating at village, sub-district and district levels with financial and administrative powers over social services including health care. Kerala is anexample of extensively implemented PRI reform, and hence offers a best-practices scenario for clear identification of contexts and pathways of influence.Our conceptual model is informed by global evidence suggesting that LPG reforms have influences on multiple governance arenas, including politics, civil society and public administration. Resultant improvements in political accountability, community empowerment and health system responsiveness can act synergistically to enhance equitable access to health care. These broad putative pathways of influence provide a basic framework for more detailed empirical investigation.Specific objectives:1. Explicate the pathways through which institutions of local participatory governance (LPG) influence access to health care for the poor and vulnerable, through a case study of the Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) local governance system in Kerala state, India2. Understand the policy context of implementation of Kerala's PRI reforms for LPG in health care3. Explore and strengthen the application of innovative Health Policy & Systems Research (HPSR) approaches in exploringLPG and its influence on equitable access to health care across different low & middle-income country (LMIC) settingsThe study will engage innovative HPSR approaches drawing on the social sciences, including realist enquiry and actor- focused approaches to policy implementation. Qualitative methodology, including in-depth interviews and focus groups conducted in four districts, will help access the lived experiences of involved policy actors (representing PRI committees, service users, civil society and health systems). Data will be analyzed using the ""framework"" approach for policy research developed by the UK National Centre for Social Research, combining pre-determined and emerging themes.Data collection strategies will be revised iteratively as the study progresses, an approach that will be fundamental to innovating with HPSR methods. Towards the end of the study, we will convene a workshop to share preliminary findings and develop a larger proposal. The larger proposal will examine the role of LPG mechanisms in facilitating greater access to services in several Indian states and countries in sub-Saharan Africa.The study emerges from needs expressed by policymakers in India, for deeper understanding of how to support LPG for health, and will fulfill that need. The integral role of NHSRC in the study will facilitate policy uptake of findings. The findings will support accountability and greater citizen participation in decisions that affect them - and ultimately greater access to healthcare for marginalized people, across LMIC settings. The study will also contribute to conceptual innovation and methods in the field of HPSR, and help strengthen UK-India research collaborations. ",31216,25/03/2014,Public Health Foundation of India,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Foundation
Improving ultra-high field MRI using parallel transmit technology.,"Parallel transmit technology is a recent innovation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that enables the sensitivity benefits possible in ultra-high field (7 Tesla) scanning to be achieved across the whole brain. The equipment requested is a parallel-transmit RF head coil. Oxford's 7 Tesla MRI scanner is already enabling researchers to study the function, structure, connectivity and metabolism of the human brain in greater detail and with higher sensitivity than had previously been possible. Ho wever, one of the greatest challenges to achieving these benefits in the broadest range of neuroscience applications is that it is difficult to obtain this high sensitivity uniformly across the brain. Some regions of the brain are essentially inaccessible at 7 Tesla due to the inhomogeneity of the RF transmission field. The most promising approach for overcoming this challenge requires parallel transmit hardware, which enables us to sculpt the transmission field. The new hardware requested will  allow researchers to expand the set of brain regions and MRI modalities that can benefit from the exquisite sensitivity offered by the 7 Tesla scanner, opening up the methods to a greater range of clinical conditions and neuroscience questions.",176400,11/06/2015,University of Oxford,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
"A synergetic adaptive non-intrusive-navigation assistance system for empowering the disabled, elderly and infirm powered wheelchair user","""Many powered wheelchair users find their medical condition and their ability to drive the wheelchair will change over time. For example, those with Multiple Sclerosis or Motor Neurone Disease will progressively lose their ability to drive safely. In order to maintainindependent mobility the powered chair will require adjustment over time to suit the user's needs. Currently, this need for regular input from the healthcare professional, and the limited resources, can result in the user having to wait weeks for appointments. This results in the user losing independent mobility for significant periods of time, consequently affecting their quality of life and that of their family and carers. Research by Dr Howells at the University of Kent has led to the development of an assistive navigation system which helps the powered wheelchair user manoeuvre through doorways and avoid obstacles. This novel method can be adjusted to an individual's requirement changes over time. Therefore this project will obtain user data from a range of users' changing abilities over time in order to provide data for adjusting the assistive system. In addition the practical usability of our existing navigational assistive prototype will be investigated by users in the real world environment in order to establish the proof-of-concept system's ability to offer practical assistance to real users.""",101087,25/08/2015,University of Kent,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research

"The Cross-Disciplinary Invention of Sexuality: Sexual Science Beyond the Medical, 1890-1940.","This project represents a fundamental rethinking of the emergence of the scientific study of human sexuality in the c19th and reconsiders how modern understandings of sexuality were constructed. We critique the hitherto dominant assumption that 'sexology' existed as a clearly understood and primarily medical field of knowledge. We present a new account of the rise of a cross-disciplinary 'sexual science' driven by dissatisfaction with exclusively medical approaches. From the 1890s, medical docto rs argued that a properly scientific understanding of sexuality required input from additional areas of knowledge (e.g. anthropology, sociology, history, literature). This project offers the first full investigation of the conceptual and cultural factors driving the evolution of a cross-disciplinary sexual science: the desire to understand the global variety of sexual behaviour; an interest in historical and cultural variation; and a new focus on the 'normal' and 'healthy' alongside the 'path ological' and 'abnormal'. We examine the ways in which these studies challenged biological explanations of sexuality, raising questions about the 'nature/nurture' divide, and brought imperially-shaped debates about race, the primitive, civilization and degeneration into the heart of sexual science. Thus the project sheds new light on the evolution of a range of categories that are central to understandings of human behaviour in the modern world. Interdisciplinary collaborations will produce m onographs, journal issues and edited collections. A stakeholder-led engagement programme will raise broader questions about the relation between medical and non-medical forms of knowledge in the past and present to address contemporary challenges surrounding sexual health and wellbeing.",420315,20/01/2015,University of Exeter,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

3D Volume Serial Block Face Imaging Facility.,"Compartmentalization of mutually exclusive reactions in different regions of cells by membrane-enclosed organelles or by self-assembling macromolecular complexes is a critical mechanism of life.  The fluorescent tags of optogenetics can display proteins confined to compartments in living cells, but gives no glimpse of the underlying ultrastructure. The electron microscope has the resolution to display cellular ultrastructure, but within very thin slices (100nm depth) from which it is difficult t o understand, measure and compare the complex cellular ultrastructure, particularly with elaborately interdigitating cells in vivo such as stem cells or neurons. Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBFSEM) provides ultrastructural resolution thoughout a much longer ( m to mm) sample depth, enabling quantitative analysis of ultrastructural features throughout the length of most complex cells. Kings seeks support from The Wellcome Trust to establish a SBFSEM with high resolution  (<3nm), optimized for biological samples, to enable quantitative analysis of cellular ultrastructure in three-dimensions.  The information from this third-dimension will transform many basic and clinical science applications at Kings and with our collaborators.  It will also be pivotal in the project at Kings, involving Nikon and JEOL, in identifying optogenetic fluorochromes within their 3D-ultrastructural context in the SBFSEM.",602744,11/06/2015,King's College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Looking forward - involving young people with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in developing an educational arts package exploring CF and gene therapy.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic conditions in the UK, affecting approximately one in 2500 people. Many patients with other genetic conditions belong to patient support groups who regularly meet socially. However, patients affected by CF cannot meet up in person due to a high risk of infection - their opportunities to debate latest scientific research related to their conditions, and its implications, are therefore currently limited. Gene therapy is often heralded as a potential future treatment for CF and first phase clinical trials are underway in the UK. Despite the frequent news headlines reporting continuing progress, the consistent and effective future use of gene therapy remains only a possibility. 'Looking forward' will comprise a team of young CF patients with clinicians, artists, scientists, educationalists and an adult patient. This team will use creative approaches to develop an educational arts package, exploring CF and gene therapy: the science, the misconceptions and the personal and social issues associated with this field of research. The package will be developed in a participatory and audience-led manner, using film, animation and writing media. Importantly, this project will explore methods of participatory engagement with individuals who cannot meet face-to-face (the CF patients).

I am particularly interested in how we can apply these results to the understanding of clinical issues (e.g. aphasic stroke and cochlear implantation), and will address the latter with studies of cochlear implant users and simulations. I also aim to extend this work to consider how the importance of social factors, such as how communicative intent affects the neural regions recruited in addition to those involved in the linguistic processing of speech.

The latest anaesthetic research will be brought to life by objects, images, audio-visuals, interactives, expert voices and personal experiences in the resulting exhibition. Senseless will compel visitors to explore anaesthesia through four themes: Consciousness (anaesthesia & consciousness); Lost Feeling (molecular mechanisms of anaesthetic drug action); Pain Game (anaesthesia & pain research); Risk Factor (risks & complications) There will also be discussion events and online content that include: Dana Centre dialogue events In-gallery 'Talkaoke' sessions (Please see supporting material) Senseless content on Antenna website Senseless will be open for nine months and will be free to the Museum's over 2.8 million annual visitors. It will provide a unique opportunity for the anaesthetic profession to consider and respond to public concerns about anaesthesia.",150000,05/05/2011,Science Museum,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Securing the legacy of British surgical history: the pre 1800 print collections at The Royal College of Surgeons of England,"1. To improve access to, and increase use of, the printed collections by researchers in the history of medicine and science by cataloguing them online. We will provide c. 5086 bibliographic entries (1936 for the pre-1700 collection; c. 3150 for the 18th century); the records will also become available via Copac National, Academic, and Specialist Library Catalogue (Copac). These collections particularly illuminate the work and collections of John Hunter (1728-1793), his contemporaries and predecessors. We will document marginalia and evidence of provenance and ownership. It is likely that up to 12% of the holdings will be unique. 2. To help improve collection management and preservation of the Library's historical collections ensuring their long term survival. This project will achieve near complete cataloguing of the College Library's unique collections providing a knowledge map at collection level which will lay the foundation to inform a sustainable long term collection management strategy by providing detailed bibliographic data. The lack of online records for these early collections hampers our efforts in this area. 3. To extend existing collaboration across library, archive and museum domains within the College to further our aim of encouraging public engagement with the history of surgery. This project will enable us to carry forward our aim of uniting 'virtually' items scattered across the all the collections and enriching the experience and understanding of our users. The College archives hold related materials already catalogued online; the planned provision of federated searching across catalogues will create new synergies between the collections.",72397,25/11/2009,Royal College of Surgeons of England,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Politics and practice: The British Veterinary Association 1881-2009,"The project will outline the history of the British Veterinary Association from its foundation (as National Veterinary Medical Association) in 1881 to the present day. It will explore the key activities of the BVA, its motives and achievements, and its leading figures The BVA is the representative body of the British veterinary profession. Its role is to promote veterinary interests to government, users of veterinary services and other stakeholders in animal health. (BVA, 2008)Throughout its history, it has aimed to reconcile differences of opinion within its diverse and often individualistic membership. Its changing structure and organization reflected shifts in veterinary roles and identities, while its publications and educational initiatives reveal the changing nature of veterinary knowledge and expertise. It therefore offers a unique window onto the history of the British veterinary profession. The goals of this project are: To produce a historical account of the BVA's organization, priorities, activities and relationships To provide insights into the broader history of veterinary medicine that will act as a basis for future, more detailed work on the history of veterinary science, practice, politics and expertise. To produce, for the interest of the veterinary profession and as a resource for other historians, a set of interviews with surviving BVA leaders",5120,30/01/2009,Imperial College London,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Embedding Dialogue & Debate,"This project extends six years of pioneering work by At-Bristol, Ecsite-uk and partners in their quest to achieve excellence in engaging the public in dialogue and debate surrounding controversial issues in biomedical science. It builds on expertise developed through two former Wellcome Trust-funded programmes, CitizenScience (led by At-Bristol) and Doing Dialogue (led by Ecsite-uk) both of which engaged young people and teachers in debates surrounding biomedicine. At-Bristol will lead the project, working in close collaboration with Ecsite-uk and skilled practitioners from five other UK science centres.Embedding Dialogue & Debate (ED&D) aims to embed dialogue surrounding all areas of bioscience within the culture of science & discovery centres, and to encourage science centres to make relevant training a part of the normal professional development programme for all staff.We will build capacity to confidently deliver activities with all visitors through the development and delivery of four Facilitator Academies. Focussing on the skills needed to discuss controversial issues rather than generic science communication, performance or presentation skills, the Facilitator Academies will equip centre staff to better achieve dialogue and communication between 'science and society' in their home venues. The Academy will encourage participants to share training with their colleagues, create a buddy system for on-going support and share dialogue resources for the sector on-line.Ultimately, ED&D will help to create a culture of discussion where people can be encouraged to consider and question key issues, particularly in relation to the ethical issues within the biosciences.It will enable people to contribute to current discussions on biomedical science, including contributing to national consultations.",228144,12/11/2008,At Bristol,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Charity
Choose Your Character website.,"Responsive Genetics Exhibits: 'My Life' or 'Choose your Character'  The proposed 'My Life'/'Choose Your Character' interactives will allow exhibition visitors to appreciate the personal impact of the science of genetics in a much more engaging way than most traditional exhibits can. Giving people the opportunity to try out characters, all based on real individual's circumstances and genetic profiles, will turn their experience of the exhibition into an intriguing exploration and motivate them to return as a different character and explore the subject in more depth later on. It should also considerably increase the likelihood of interaction and debate amongst visitors around the exhibits themselves.  The science behind genetics, genetic counselling, DNA profiling and heritability in general is complex and hard to communicate even to adults in spite of being intensely relevant to people's lives. 'My Life'/'Choose Your Character' will make people's journeys through this subject area enjoyable, if potentially disturbing at times. In their 'surrogate' roles they will be spoken to directly by medical and scientific specialists as they learn if 'their' character is liable to particular diseases, has committed a serious crime or could become an Olympic athlete.  A combination of much formative evaluation and user-testing, combined with resources held back during the two years following initial installation, will ensure that all the important lessons learned by observing and questioning visitors are incorporated into the final product.  The set of exhibits would cover approximately 150 square metres and would be transportable if several centres wanted to present them over time.",4900,22/09/2009,Windfall Films,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Company

"Medicine, birth and death at the Tudor court","Henry VIII looms large over English history, and will loom larger in 2009 at the 500th anniversary of his succession. Everyone knows that Henry had six wives and founded the Church of England. Many fewer people are aware that his reign also witnessed the first laws passed by Parliament against sodomy, arguably marked the start of the professionalisation of medicine and certainly brought a new focus on medical practice in areas such as conception and childbirth. Medicine, Birth and Death at the Tudor Court, a series of public engagement events combining expert-led research into Tudor medicine with drama, will enage a series of audiences (numbering in total at least 11,000) both with the medical history of the Tudor period and a range of current issues in biomedical science. At the heart of the programme will be a site-specific devised theatrical production entitled A Little Neck to be staged by Goat and Monkey Theatre Company at Hampton Court. This drama will invite its audience to experience Hampton Court in a new way - as a place of birth and death, health and illness; a place where a miscarriage could be regarded as punishment from God, where physicians sought the secrets of the womb and where courtiers demanded more active medical care. The project will also engage in a range of other public activities including lectures and workshops all of which will be designed to help people understand the history of medicine during the reign of Henry VIII.",59400,13/11/2008,Oxford Brookes University,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

Forty years of gastrointestinal motility; scientific achievements and their impact on clinical practice.,"Translational Medicine, the current term for the process of research development between bench and bedside, is gaining in political importance with increasing concern about the value for money of bioscience led clinical developments, and validity of the linear bench to bedside model as the explanation for medical progress. This project aims to explore the recent history of bench-bedside relationships in a specific research field well known to the applicant (gastrointestinal motility), choosin g one successful (Chronic Idiopathic Intestinal Obstruction) and one unsuccessful (Migrating Motor Complex) example for comparison. The key goal of the project will be to explore these successes and failures of translation by review of a primary source  the published proceedings of the International Motility Symposia, which has met biannually since 1969 and represents the premier forum for presentation of biological and clinical discovery in the field. Both the written record and the reco llections of pioneer researchers will be consulted, to discover processes which worked and those which did not. A secondary literature review will also determine the impact of discovery on clinical practice. From this small study it should be possible to synthesise more general views on requirements for successful translation and their implications for bioscience policy.",38510,13/03/2008,University of Manchester,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research
Reconciling Cholinergic and inflammatory hypotheses of delirium: acute and lasting effects of systemic inflammation on chronic neurodegeneration.,"Delirium causes acute psychological impairments and accelerates the process of cognitive decline and is highly prevalent in aging and dementia. Delirium is commonly caused by systemic infection, surgery or injury and we have exploited these interactions of systemic inflammation with ongoing dementia to develop the first animal model of delirium during dementia. However, delirium caused by administration of anti-cholinergic drugs has led to a consensus view of delirium as an acute cholinergic def iciency. Here we propose a mouse model of delirium during dementia that reflects its multi-factorial etiology and attempts to reconcile inflammatory and cholinergic hypotheses of delirium. By superimposing systemic inflammation upon prior pathology in the basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, presumed to be hypoactive in delirium, we will investigate the cognitive, neurochemical and inflammatory consequences of these insults. Both models are founded on the concept, which we originally described, t hat microglia are primed by chronic neurodegeneration to produce exaggerated responses to subsequent inflammatory stimulation. We will further investigate the nature of microglial priming and its contribution to the acute delirium-like  episode and to exacerbation of underlying pathology and resulting long-term cognitive decline post-delirium. The involvement of interleukin-1beta and interferon-beta in cognitive and pathological exacerbations will be investigated in detail.",1222442,22/03/2010,Trinity College Dublin,The Wellcome Trust,,N,elderly,Research
From communication to deliberation: the impacts of new forms of public engagement on biomedical scientists - extension,"The goal of the proposed research is to provide rigorous policy advice concerning the opportunities and barriers that are encountered by biomedical scientists with respect to the development and establishment of methods of public engagement with biomedical science. To achieve this, the research objective is to collect data on the understandings, experiences and responses to notions of public engagement by interviewing scientists working in the biomedical sciences. The primary project outcome is a comprehensive, empirically-based analysis of understandings of 'the public' and 'public engagement' from within biomedical science. These research goals will be achieved through three research methodologies: 1. A literature review of the relevant academic, policy and practitioner literature; 2. Semi-structured interviews with scientists working in selected areas of the biomedical sciences; and 3. The collation of relevant public statements (in the media and at public events) by biomedical scientists. Project outcomes will be enhanced through dissemination of the research results to end-user and academic groups (primarily via an interim report and end-user workshop, a final report, a prestigious launch seminar, other end-user speaker opportunities, and academic journal articles and conferences).",10000,13/07/2010,London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE),The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

p(L)ace of change,"p(L)ace of change (PoC) is a media led investigation into the rapid development occurring in Viet Nam; the impact this change has on health and wellbeing and what communities have to say about it. For this first phase, we will deliver a series of community authored films tied together with professional media, developed in consultation with scientists. The resulting DVD will then be used in facilitated community discussions. The project has a dual aim in that it will engage communities at the grassroots level and at later phases to be promoted back into a developedcountry setting. Since the Perestroika like reforms beginning in 1986, ???i M?i? has catapulted Viet Nam into the 21st century. Change has affected every vein of life ? from massive urbanization and the growth of an affluent middle class, to savage deforestation in border areas. Coming from a health and science perspective the project will work with the communities to document the impact of change. The starting point for PoC will be the community, where we will teach selected groups the necessary skills to create their own Digital Stories, focusing on health, development and the environment - engaging individuals with the issues around them. Focus areas will be developed as part of an ongoing discourse with science professionals ? aiming for the greater engagement of research professionals with their study communities. Alongside the community authored content, professional filmmakers and health researchers will develop media that enhances the local narratives, adding scientific quality and depth to the content. Through two later phases, the project will culminate in a novel media site that facilitates community discourse as well as global awareness of development issues, captivating and educating audiences through touching personal stories, rigorous science and a uniquely interactive experience.",29400,05/08/2010,University of Oxford,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research

Understanding Transient Neonatal Diabetes (Type 1),"This proposal aims to bring together scientists, clinicians and patients in a supportive environment to share knowledge and experience of biomedical science in a one day workshop. This will engage a new audience affected by Transient Neonatal Diabetes (type 1) with the field of epigenetics that provides an explanation for the inheritance of their condition. Epigenetics is likely to become as important as genetics for diagnosis of human disease and yet we have very little experience in how to explain it effectively. This workshop will provide a unique opportunity for us to explore methods of conveying information about epigenetics to lay audiences. This process will also examine in a broader sense the psychosocial and ethical impact of biomedical information on the individual. Our event should strengthen ties and enable improved future follow up with families, essential to understanding the reasons behind later recurrence of diabetes and the goal of the UK transient neonatal diabetes register. Long term collaboration between scientists and families will be enhanced by the development of a user friendly website.This collaboration between patients, scientists and clinicians will encourage high quality interdisciplinary practice by stimulating debate and forging new ways of approaching basic and translational research.",7790,14/07/2010,University of Southampton,The Wellcome Trust,,N,environment,Research
"""The great dread: The 'Russian' influenza in the United Kingdom, 1869-1901","The 'Russian' influenza pandemic of 1889-93 has been called the first 'truly global' pandemic of influenza. Coinciding with the growth. of the Worldwide telegraphic network and the Victorian boom in newspaper publishing, the pandemic was the object of intense media interest and unprecedented scientific scrutiny. As with H1N1 swine flu in 2009, it also provoked widespread anxiety- fears that were often far in excess of the pandemic's actual destructiveness: My thesis explores these medical, cultural and emotional responses via national and local newspaper 1 . reports, medical journals, official reports and the letters and literary works of prominent survivors. In an era when sanitary reforms were helping to reduce fears of other infectious diseases, I argue that the 'Russian' pandemic- so-called because the first outbreak occurred in St Petersburg in the autumn of 1889- undermined Victorian confidence in 'state medicine', fuelling a morbid dread of influenza. This dread was initially driven by vivid newspaper reports of the spreading morbidity - reports that led to the accusation in the Lancet that the epidemic had 1 been 'started by telegraph.' However, by 1892 dread of influenza increasingly attached to mortal respiratory infections - an association that was underlined by the sudden death of Queen Victoria's grandson, the Duke of Clarence, and the science of vital statistics. One reason that influenza has been so perplexing to social historians is that it is a protean, sphinx-like infection that is forever changing its medical identity. Thus by the later 1890s influenza was increasingly seen as a 'nervous' disease that could spark mental disturbances ranging from depression and I neurasthenia to psychosis and suicide. In a period when anxieties about technological change and other tropes of modernity were fuelling growing political concerns about fatigue and degeneration, I argue that this also made influenza something of a cultural weathervane.",3440,13/07/2010,Misc England,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Individual

"Higher, Further, Colder: Extreme Physiology and Endurance c1900-1980","The overarching aim of this project is to write the history of a neglected area of physiological research in twentieth-century Britain, and draw broader connections between this research and other popular and scientific understandings of bodily identities. I will examine research into the limits of the human body, i.e. under environmental and exercise stress, by looking at archive material relating to key researchers and to organisations which funded relevant research. In particular I will inv estigate three specific themes - the body's reaction to extremes of temperature, high-altitude mountain environments, and notions of absolute endurance and fatigue - which my previous research has identified as central questions in this particular area of physiology. This project will also allow me to focus on the athlete and the explorer, who were both the experimental objects, and the main 'users', of these experiments and their findings. Mythologies of sporting amateurism and heroic explora tion have played important roles - as a large secondary literature shows - in the construction of national and gender identities, particularly British masculinity.

Access Denied: The Roles of Clinical Knowledge and Moral Discourse in Mediating Access to Psychological Therapies.,"This project engages with the ethical/moral dilemmas clinical psychologists face when seeking to facilitate access to what they consider to be appropriate psychological therapies. Barriers to access are frustrating for and potentially damaging to patients, and recognised by psychologists as a real, serious, and often-ignored ethical concern. The project will examine this dilemma through qualitative methods, employing analytical frameworks from science and technology studies and connecting with a nd contributing to work on empirical mental health ethics. The current context within which psychologists make decisions about access to therapies will be mapped, with interviews exploring how professionals construct, negotiate and respond to the ethical dilemmas they face when seeking to mediate access to what they consider to be the most appropriate psychological therapy. In so doing, the project will cast new light on the experiences of and challenges for clinical psychologists and increase o ur understanding of how access to psychological therapies both involves ethical principles and dilemmas and creates new normative challenges. Using new dialogical methods (including consultation with stakeholders like GPs and service-user organisations), I will then recommend ways in which access to appropriate psychological therapies might be more effectively promoted in ethically-robust ways.",218638,18/11/2010,University of Edinburgh,The Wellcome Trust,,N,science,Research

The Wonderbox Initiative,"Have you ever cooked something in a bean bag? Well, the Wonderbox is a heat retention bag (in the shape of a box), made from material and polystyrene balls in which food can be fully cooked at little cost. Basically, a bean bag cooker. Heat Retention Cooking works by bringing food to the boil in an ordinary pot and then placing the pot into an insulated container (the Wonderbox). This keeps the heat in and allows the food to cook over a period of time _研 it might be simplest to think of a heat retention cooker as an unpowered slow cooker. Testing with a women's group in Glasgow demonstrates that used 2-3 times a week a Wonder Box can save anywhere between a quarter to a third on a user_验s electricity or gas spend. One user in Glasgow consistently saves 耄5-耄6 per week on electricity. Wonder Boxes are inherently safe, food won_验t stick or burn and there is no risk of fire. Many people experiencing poverty have good cooking skills and know how to make good nutritional choices for their families but the high cost of fuel coupled with inefficient appliances means they rely on microwaves because this is the fastest and therefore lowest cost route. Our aim would be to work with 15-20 people who are struggling with poverty or inequality, through developing the Wonderbox Initiatives in 2-3 support groups, giving them the skills to make the boxes for themselves, the confidence to use them, the encouragement of sharing and trying favourite recipes and the capacity to continue these initiatives within their support groups once our worker has finished. Cooking in a bean bag. Strange, but true. And good for the environment too.",4140,02/12/2016,Faith in Community Dundee,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,Dundee ,N,environment,Community
