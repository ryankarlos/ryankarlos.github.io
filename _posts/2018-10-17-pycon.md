Last month, I attended PyCon UK from 15 to 19th Sep at Cardiff City Hall.
I also had my proposal accepted for presenting a couple of posters on 
Twitter Analytics and Explainable AI. The work on Twitter Analytics was 
part of my Msc project which I had been working on, in collaboration with 
the company I was working at. I was in between jobs and thought it would be a 
good idea to attend a conference and present some of the work, I had done over 
the past year. I also lucky enough to get some funding for travel and accommodation 
through the PyCon financial assistance programme. In addition, all attendees who
have a proposal accepted, get a free ticket to attend the conference.

The venue was very nice - an old town hall with different halls for different
sessions of the conference. There were a number of parallel tracks on all things 
python, including workshops - which I attended on Spark in Databricks and 
test driven development (TDD) in python with pytest.

I was allocated a slot for the poster session. Feedback was generally good, with some interesting discussions during the 
session and useful questions afterwards. The link to a notebook with the results 
presented in one of my posters using python's lime package can be found in 
this [notebook](https://github.com/ryankarlos/Explainable_AI/blob/master/LIME_bank_marketing.ipynb)
I will be adding a separate detailed blog about the work on twitter analytics, including the data visualisation i had built in D3.

The final day was mainly sprint sessions - where people were contributing to open
source libraries or creating useful material for the community in small groups. 
I spent an hour or so in a group creating [simple python examples](https://github.com/jfine2358/python-show-and-tell)
demonstrating things like string formatting, expression functions, using `zip()` function with 
iterators etc
