A couple of months ago i took part in Hacktoberfest, a month-long event in October every year
that encourages people around the world to contribute to open source projects.
The first 50,000 people who make at least five pull requests to any public Github project 
between 1-31 October, receive a free special Hacktoberfest T-Shirt.

I had started contributing to my first ever open source issue during the pandas sprint at 
PyData London conference I had attended in April. The [sprint](https://python-sprints.github.io/london/2018/04/29/pydata-london.html) was mainly working on
was mainly focussed on improving pandas documentation. I worked on the following [issue](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/21026)
to improve the pandas docstring for `Series.str.rsplit` and `Series.str.split` api, which
was eventually merged in.
I quite enjoyed the experience, so I decided to work on further fixes during Hacktoberfest, related to documentation, testing and deprecation.
The requirement is only for PRs to be opened between the qualifying dates. They could eventually be merged at a later stage. This was very handy as big projects 
like pandas have a very strict and stringent review process and can sometimes take weeks or even months
for a PR to get merged in. For example, this [PR](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/23259) which I opened 
during Hacktoberfest, was eventually merged  a month later.  In addition, it also depends on reviewer availability. 

I received this lovely t-shirt in December, which I will be wearing proudly wherever I go.
