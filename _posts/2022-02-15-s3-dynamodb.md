This article presents an entirely serverless approach to ingest data in bulk from csv in S3 bcuket to DynamoDB using AWS Lambda.
In addition, we will also show how we can publish a message to sns topic when data is successfully loaded into DynamoDB
and configure an SQS queue subscribe to this topic.
